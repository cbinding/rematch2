{"text":"An archaeological trench evaluation was undertaken by AC archaeology during July 2023 on land at Hartnoll Farm, Tiverton, Devon (centred on NGR SS 9898 1288). The evaluation comprised the machine excavation of 33 trenches totaling 1640m in length with each trench 1.8m wide. Trenches were positioned to target anomalies identified by a previous geophysical survey, as well as in what were thought to be blank areas. The site is located where previous investigations nearby had identified evidence for late prehistoric settlement, funerary and agricultural occupation. The main archaeological features identified during the present work were comparable to previous results and comprised two probable cremation pits representing potential evidence for an Early Bronze Age flat cemetery in the southwest part of the site, as well as part of a ring ditch of a probable ploughed-down former barrow to the southeast. Adjacent to this was a linear ditch likely to be part of a wider pattern of early field division. Elsewhere across the site mainly former ditches were present, with the majority of these of post medieval/modern date and related to agricultural field division and drainage.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1116083","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"acarchae2-517986_214251.pdf"}],"title":"Land at Hartnoll Farm, Tiverton, Devon: Results of an archaeological trench evaluation","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1116083","docType":"report"}}
{"text":"\tPhoenix Consulting Archaeology Limited commissioned Allen Archaeology Limited to undertake a geophysical survey using magnetometry on land off Sherington Road, Lathbury, Buckinghamshire, as part of a planning application for an extension to a sand and gravel quarry. The geophysical survey consisted of a detailed gradiometer survey of Areas 1 and 2, coming to approximately 18 hectares. The survey was undertaken in a series of 30m grids across the site. The geophysical survey has identified a number of archaeological features within both survey areas. Within Area 1 a rectilinear/subrectangular positive feature corresponded with an Iron Age/Roman enclosure identified during previous archaeological work. The survey also identified an area of likely Iron Age roundhouses, with likely different phases of activity as some of the ditches appeared to overlay one another. There were also potential enclosure ditches either side of the potential roundhouse features. Ridge and furrow was seen across the entire of the southwestern part of Area 1, whilst features likely associated with flooding events of the River Ouse were identified within the northeastern part of the area. Two linear dipolar features were identified likely representing buried modern drainage features. Within Area 2 a couple of former trackways and associated small enclosures were identified. A linear feature was also seen that might relate to the settlement/agricultural features, but could instead relate to the former railway line which once ran across the site. The survey also revealed a large number of positive amorphous features which potentially relate to former flooding events or palaeochannels across the site. The northwestern part of this area appears to lie within the flood plain of the River Ouse (Figure 11), which likely explains the presence of features related to flooding or previous river channels","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119592","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"allenarc1-513712_214540.pdf"}],"title":"Geophysical Survey by Magnetometry Survey on Land off Sherington Road, Lathbury, Buckinghamshire","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119592","docType":"report"}}

{"text":"The archaeological strip, map and sample excavation extended across c.2.64 ha area at the easternmost extent of the development scheme, within the location of two proposed artificial grass covered playing field. Removal of the topsoil and overburden was undertaken using a tracked 360 mechanical excavator equipped with a toothless ditching bucket under constant archaeological supervision. Overburden, comprising topsoil and subsoil, was removed to the level of the first significant archaeological horizon. Due to the adverse weather conditions encountered during winter, wheeled dumpers were replaces by a bladed tracked dozer which resulted in the need for the northern third of the site to be excavated using a 'window technique'. All archaeological remains uncounted on the site were excavated and recorded in accordance with the methodology outlined in the approved WSI. Archaeological excavation was successful in characterising the archaeological remains present within the development area and provided a long history of multiphase past human activity spanning from the Early Neolithic through to the Medieval period. The Early Neolithic presence was limited to the heavily truncated remnants of a post-built structure and a waste-pit radiocarbon dated to 3947-3715 BC. Succeeding activity spanned from the Early Beaker period to the Early Bronze Age and included a Beaker ‘midden’ pit dated to 2398-2146 cal BC, and then a funerary ring-ditch monument which enclosed four inhumations and two cremations, and had been developed over five distinct phases radiocarbon dated from 2026-1896 BC through to 1869-1621 BC. A contemporary or subsequent phase of what appears to be domestic occupation immediately adjacent to the ring ditch took place as represented by a small rectangular building dated to 2133-1938 cal BC with possible midden pits, and also a roundhouse, the latter either at the same time or possibly at some stage in the Early Bronze Age. Iron Age activity, sub-divided into three broad phases, demonstrated a change in land-use, as attested by the presence of a roundhouse and gradual establishment and renewal of a multi-phase pastoral enclosure system, as well as by the presence of associated structures and waste pits . Ridge and furrow belonging to the medieval period indicated the final change in landscape management marking the shift towards arable agriculture.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1112257","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"archaeol5-511552_193431.pdf"}],"title":"Strip Map And Sample at Ponteland School and Leisure Centre","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1112257","docType":"report"}}
{"text":"Investigation of three mitigation excavation areas, targeted on results of preceding evaluation, totalling 18,393sq m. The earliest tangible evidence of occupation on the site was identified in the Prehistoric period, with a low density scatter of pits occurring in Area 1 and Area 3 of early to middle Neolithic date, as well as broadly prehistoric. A large ring-ditch was identified within Area 3 and, although no firm dating evidence or burial was recovered, is posited to be the remains of a round barrow of earlier Bronze Age construction. Unenclosed, dispersed early Medieval (5th–7th century) settlement activity was evidenced by up to 17 sunken-featured buildings, two possible post-built buildings, associated pitting and artefact/debris-rich soil layers. These layers are posited to comprise levelled/spread midden deposits that were preserved in the tops of natural hollows in the landscape. They contained significant quantities of both early Saxon and reused Roman material, including animal bone and metalwork, that attest to a variety of domestic and craft activities being undertaken within the settlement. Some high status metalwork items are included in the recovered assemblage. It is further posited that the Bronze Age barrow was reused in this period, with early Saxon material recovered from the ring-ditch upper fills. During the high medieval period a multi-phase rectilinear field system was established, aligned approximately ENE/WSW, positioned perpendicular to the River Gipping. The positioning of a field corner directly over the prehistoric barrow remains hints that the field system may have been laid out with reference to it. A further part of this fieldscape had previously been found in excavations to the south-west in 2016–17. Other elements seem to be the precursor of the northern boundary of the Bishop’s Hop Ground, depicted on the 1848 Bramford Tithe Map. Post-medieval and modern remains included a few field boundaries, one of which persisted into the modern period and was incorporated into the northern boundary of allotment gardens, shown on the 1926 Ordnance Survey map and on 1945 aerial photographs.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119840","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"archaeol6-514817_212394.pdf"}],"title":"Archaeological Excavations.

{"text":"Following the results of two trial-trench evaluations, five excavation areas were targeted, totalling c.0.76ha in Field 2 (Areas C and D) and c.0.74ha in Field 3 (Areas E, F and G). Early Neolithic and Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age pits appear to represent a limited and transitory presence in the landscape. Slightly more tangible evidence was uncovered for Middle to Late Bronze Age activity in the form of pit clusters containing possible structured deposits of pottery. By the earliest Iron Age, there were one, or possibly two roundhouses as well as an intensive area of possible quarrying but the landscape remained unenclosed and there were few other well-defined features. Fairly limited finds and environmental remains were recovered, making the nature of any settlement activity unclear. Near the southern extent of the excavations a small group of pits produced one fragment of Roman tegula. Some residual Roman pottery and coins were also recovered further north where Roman CBM had possibly been reused in the medieval period. The likely Roman pits were overlain by a buried soil, cut by a truncated oven feature, which was probably used in crop-processing. The oven was assigned to the mid-9th-10th centuries AD based on the results of archaeomagnetic dating. Nearby, the terminus of ditch and a few other pits produced a small amount of Middle to Late Saxon pottery and a loomweight. It is likely that these remains are associated with an area of Middle/Late Saxon settlement recorded c. 200m to south at Copdock Interchange (WSH 012). In mid-12th-earlier 14th centuries, two large boundary ditches enclosed an area including several iterations of NW/SE / NE/SW field system ditches, interpreted as defining fields or enclosure plots. Other features include pits, a natural hollow possibly used for drainage, a large oven set within a building or light structure and another smaller oven/hearth. No direct evidence for buildings was recovered although the concentration of finds suggests that a dwelling was probably located nearby. The remains comprise a small farmstead, primarily engaged in arable agriculture. It is uncertain whether the heated structures relate to crop-processing or bread baking but the large, covered oven structure may hint at some degree of specialisation in one or both of these activities. Historical records indicate that this part of the site lay on glebe land, which may have been granted to support the living of a clergyman at the foundation of the parish of Felchurch. Although post-holes associated with the oven structure had previously been interpreted in the evaluation as possibly associated with the lost church in the parish, no evidence for this was uncovered during further excavation. Later post-medieval remains include a ditch which is recorded on 1837 Washbrook Tithe map. This follows a somewhat similar orientation to one of the main medieval boundary ditches; however, finds and historical records suggest it was probably not in place until the later post-medieval period.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119492","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"archaeol6-521703_217323.pdf"}],"title":"Final Archive Report: Archaeological Investigation at Wolsey Grange Phase 1 - Fields 2 and 3, Sproughton, Ipswich, Suffolk","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119492","docType":"report"}}
{"text":"The evaluation fieldwork comprised the excavation of 12 trenches, each measuring 50m long by 1.8m wide, in the locations shown in Figure 2. The trenches were located to test geophysical anomalies and to provide a representative sample of the remainder of the site, as a means of prospection for remains of a type or period that may not respond to geophysical survey, in order to ascertain the nature and state of preservation of any archaeological features present. Trenches were set out on OS National Grid co-ordinates using Leica GPS. Overburden was stripped from the trenches by a mechanical excavator fitted with a toothless grading bucket. All machining was conducted under archaeological supervision to the top of the natural substrate, which was the level at which archaeological features were first encountered. Archaeological features/deposits were investigated, planned and recorded in accordance with CA Technical Manual 1: Fieldwork Recording Manual. Deposits were assessed for their palaeoenvironmental potential and samples were taken in accordance with CA Technical Manual 2: The Taking and Processing of Environmental and Other Samples from Archaeological Sites. Artefacts were processed in accordance with CA Technical Manual 3: Treatment of Finds Immediately after Excavation. CA will make arrangements with the Northamptonshire Archaeological Resource Centre (NARC) for the deposition of the project archive and, subject to agreement with the legal landowner(s), the artefact collection. A digital archive will also be prepared and deposited with the Archaeology Data Service (ADS). The archives (museum and digital) will be prepared and deposited in accordance with Standard and guidance for the creation, compilation, transfer and deposition of archaeological archives (CIfA 2014; updated October 2020). A summary of information from this project, as set out in Appendix D, will be entered onto the OASIS online database of archaeological projects in Britain. Between March and April 2022, Cotswold Archaeology carried out an archaeological evaluation of the Alban Mann land at Bell Plantation Garden Centre, Towcester, Northamptonshire. A total of twelve trenches were excavated across the proposed development site, targeting anomalies identified by a preceding geophysical survey. A number of linear ditches were encountered in the trenches, matching geophysical anomalies which suggest the presence of a system of rectilinear enclosures and field systems, as well as possible trackways linking different elements of the agricultural landscape. A scatter of apparently isolated small/medium sized pits were also present, although no evidence for structural, domestic or industrial remains was encountered. The majority of the pottery assemblage recovered from the Site dates to between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, with a relative scarcity of late Roman pottery fabrics and forms pointing towards a decline in activity from the late 3rd century onwards. The pottery assemblage is dominated by utilitarian forms; jars or probable jars and some bowls, although the presence of beakers and flagons in smaller quantities would indicate the service and consumption of liquids. The dominance of coarsewares and relative scarcity of finewares suggests relatively low status activity associated with general domestic usage. The limited environmental evidence recovered from bulk soil samples taken from features in Trenches 6, 7, and 8 was indicative of windblown/dispersed waste material only, with no indication of crop-processing, food preparation, or other settlement or industrial activity. A human skull and several possible cremation vessels were also observed in the basal fill of a ditch in trench 12, most likely disturbed from elsewhere and discarded into the ditch.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1112495","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"cotswold2-512313_207882.pdf"}],"title":"Evaluation at Alban Mann Land, Bell Plantation Garden Centre, Towcester, Northamptonshire","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1112495","docType":"report"}}
{"text":"The scope of Archaeological Recording at the Site was shaped by the results of the previous phases of investigation that comprised two Geophysical Surveys, Part 1 (1EW03-FUS-EV-REP-CS07_CL14-007768) and Part 2 (1EW03-FUS_CNA-EV-REP-CS07_CL14-000003), and Trial Trench Evaluation (1EW03-FUS_MHI-EV-REP-CS07_CL14-000009). The conclusion drawn from these stages of archaeological investigations was that the foci of activity lay in area C32087 as outlined in the AWHi Project Plan for Archaeological Recording at Welsh Road, Northamptonshire (1EW03-FUS-EV-REP-C000-009807). The overlying plough soil was removed mechanically and reduced to the archaeological horizon under archaeological supervision. All identified archaeological features were surveyed and a pre-excavation plan was created. An intervention plan was proposed by the supervising archaeologist on site and agreed with their manager and the HERDS management team to determine where the interventions would be placed. These features were excavated, recorded and a post-excavation survey plan was generated. The results of the excavations indicate activity primarily dating to the middle to late Iron Age, with activity focused on a series of enclosures. There is limited evidence for an earlier prehistoric presence with lithics recovered from several features. Further assessment of the lithics may provide additional insight into the chronology and nature of this activity. Across the site there was evidence for the impact of later medieval to modern agricultural activities in the truncation of several of the features by a series of north to south furrows.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119064","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"hs2molah1-502394_219346.pdf"}],"title":"AWHi - Post-Excavation Assessment Report for Archaeological Recording at Welsh Road, Northamptonshire AC310: C32087e","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119064","docType":"report"}}

A further 1% contingency sample was held in reserve should more archaeological remains be revealed beyond that identified within the geophysical survey. The trenches were generally positioned in accordance with the WSI, though Trench 25 was relocated further to the south-west in order to investigate a geophysical anomaly of probable archaeological origin in the south-west of Area 6. Trench 19 (Area 6) was also extended by 3m to the south-west in order to establish the continuation of the ditch seen in Trenches 17 and 18. In addition, Trench 59 (Area 2) was repositioned directly to the south-west to target an agricultural trend and other anomalies of possible natural origin detected by the geophysical survey. Following the excavation of Trench 40 (Area 1), a 20m-long extension was added, creating a T-shaped arrangement, in order to confirm the termination of the trackway ditch as suggested by the geophysical survey results. The trenches were laid out using a GPS with sub-15mm accuracy. They were excavated using an appropriately powered mechanical excavator fitted with a toothless bucket under the direct supervision of an archaeologist. Spoil was stored adjacent to, but at a safe distance from, the trench edges. Machining continued in even spits down to the top of the undisturbed natural geology or the first archaeological horizon, whichever was encountered first. The exposed surfaces were sufficiently cleaned to establish the presence/absence of archaeological remains. As outlined in the WSI, a sufficient sample of each feature or deposit type, for example pits and ditches, was hand excavated and recorded. Oxford Archaeology carried out a second phase of archaeological trial-trench evaluation at the site of a proposed community woodland project near Bicester, Oxfordshire, between March and April 2022. Cherwell District Council commissioned the fieldwork in order to inform their woodland design to help protect archaeological remains. The site is in an area of considerable archaeological interest, situated immediately north of the Roman town of Alchester, close to the crossroads of two Roman roads. A preceding geophysical survey of the site undertaken in 2019 detected a number of anomalies of probable and possible archaeological origin, across seven areas. These included linear anomalies suggestive of a trackway and associated rectilinear field system across Areas 1 and 2 and a series of linear and curvilinear anomalies suggestive of a large sub-circular enclosure and rectilinear enclosure/field system in Area 6. An initial phase of evaluation of Area 5 carried out by Oxford Archaeology in 2020 revealed the remains of a late Bronze Age/Iron Age ditch and a second undated ditch, which corresponded with features identified in the geophysical survey. A total of 50 trenches were undertaken across Areas 1, 2, 6 and 7 as part of the Phase 2 evaluation, the majority of which were targeted on selected geophysical anomalies. Of these, 16 trenches were found to contain archaeological features, predominately comprising ditches together with a small number of pits, a posthole and plough furrows. A good correlation between the results of the geophysical survey and the archaeological evaluation was demonstrated.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1112629","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"oxfordar1-513009_208591.pdf"}],"title":"Evaluation at Burnehyll Community Woodland, Bicester","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1112629","docType":"report"}}

Four phases of activity were revealed within the excavation area that span the prehistoric to post-medieval periods, with a peak during the Early Roman period. The earliest activity (Phase 1) dates to the Early Bronze Age and comprised a small number of pits containing pottery and/or worked flint. A sample from one of these pits produced evidence of crabapple and hazelnuts. A single Beaker inhumation burial was also found. Phase 2 is represented by several pits that produced Middle Iron Age pottery, with sherds of this date also present in later (Phase 3) features. Most of the features date to the Late Iron Age to Roman period (Phase 4) and comprised a possible sub-square enclosure in the western part of the site that was later replaced by larger sub-rectangular stock enclosure and associated internal features. To the east were several ditches, pits and a hearth which yielded pottery, animal bone, fired clay, charred grains and charcoal indicative of domestic settlement waste. Other finds from the site include metalworking debris and two copper-alloy brooches of 1st-century date.

{"text":"Wessex Archaeology undertook an archaeological strip, map and sample excavation, evaluation trenching and targeted watching briefs on c. 125 ha of land to the south-west of Rossington and east of Wadworth, South Yorkshire. This investigation focused on geophysical anomalies and cropmarks. The work was carried out in advance of the Rossington Inland Port development (Phase 2) This investigation confirmed the presence of a field system, trackways and associated enclosed areas of occupation and/or settlement. Material culture recovered during the work is predominantly of Late Iron Age/Romano-British date, with a small number of earlier prehistoric and post-Roman items.It is recommended that the project archive resulting from the excavation be deposited with Doncaster Museum. Between 2016–7 Wessex Archaeology undertook excavations between Rossington and Doncaster in South Yorkshire prior to the development of a strategic rail freight interchange. The earliest evidence related to peat formation within two different parts of the site, with a pair of sequences radiocarbon dated to between the Mesolithic period and the Bronze Age. Pollen preserved within the peat provides evidence for woodland development over this period, with no clear signs of any contemporary human impacts on the palynological record. The majority of the archaeological evidence relates to the Romano-British period, when the site contained settlement/farming enclosures and fields used for grazing and cultivation. Archeologically detectable activity was focussed on the enclosures; a stone-built ‘T’-shaped crop-dryer reveals malt production was undertaken in one. The animal bone is relatively informative when compared to regional norms and this evidence, which is accompanied by the results of the analysis of organic residues within the pottery assemblage, suggest a husbandry strategy focussed on cattle carcass products, with some dairying. Charcoal evidence and charred/waterlogged plant remains reveal further information on the agricultural economy of the site including aspects such as crops grown, fuel use and the local environment. The finds assemblage from the site is also relatively rich for the area and suggests a reasonable degree of integration with the economy of the wider Roman province.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1116755","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"wessexar1-269267_213359.pdf"}],"title":"Rossington Inland Port, Phase 2 Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

Machine excavation proceeded until either the archaeological horizon or the natural geology was exposed. The earliest features comprised ditches and pits dated to the Middle/Late Iron Age, located in the west and east of the site. Finds of Middle to Late Iron Age pottery, along with animal bone were recovered from the ditch and pit fills. The ditches aligned well with anomalies from the preceding geophysical survey, forming the boundaries of enclosures and the drip gullies of roundhouses. Ditches and a pit containing Romano-British pottery were recorded in the west of the site. The pottery indicated that the features were in use until the late 2nd to late 3rd century. Post-medieval furrows were identified in the west of the site, while the potential remains of a windmill mound were recorded in the south-east. A field boundary of post-medieval date was also uncovered in the south-east corner of the site, while a modern pit was recorded in the north. A good number of the ditches, gullies, pits and postholes recorded across the site remain undated, including a group of ditches in the west of the site that correlated well with a complex of enclosures identified on the geophysical survey.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1112404","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"wessexar1-512723_209282.pdf"}],"title":"Lodge Farm Solar, Wistow, Leicestershire: Archaeological evaluation","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1112404","docType":"report"}}
{"text":"Wessex Archaeology was commissioned by Low Carbon UK Solar Investment Company Ltd to conduct an archaeological evaluation of a 60.63 hectare parcel of land located to the west of Dean Hill Road, near Willand in Devon. The evaluation area is centred on NGR 301964 110924 The evaluation consisted of a proposed 137 trial trenches targeted on the results of a preceding geophysical survey, equating to a 2.3% sample of the useable hectarage within the proposed development area. The fieldwork was undertaken in two phases, the first phase consisted of 36 trenches was undertaken between 13 March and 29 March 2023. The second phase consisted of 93 trial trenches and was undertaken between 2 May and 9 June 2023. Eight trenches (Tr 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13 & 84) were not excavated due to Health & Safety concerns and part of the site being under crop. The recorded archaeological remains comprised mainly ditches and pits, with a small number of stake holes, a possible hearth, and a cobbled surface. These features spanned from the Bronze Age through to the post-medieval period with the most significant quantity features dating from the Late Iron Age to Romano British period, and the Medieval period. Several features remain of uncertain date. There was also some evidence of earlier prehistoric activity within the Site as indicated by the flint assemblage which was primarily unstratified and thinly distributed over the area of investigation. Within the constraints of the evaluation, it was possible to determine that many of the linear features observed were likely to function as field boundaries and enclosure ditches, with at least three curvilinear ditches, tentatively interpreted as ring ditches also being identified. An Early Roman ditch showed evidence of a stake-built structure in its base contemporary with the use of the ditch. Discrete features were focused primarily within a NE-SW aligned band across the central portion of the site with a few outliers to the north and south and consisted of probable charcoal production pits along with a lesser number of rubbish pits. A cobbled surface and a possible hearth were also recorded. The evidence for Bronze Age activity was sparse and consisted of two features, a potential ring ditch and a ditch terminus. The two features were geographically separated by over 275 m and the tentative dating of the finds recovered from them limits any discussion with regards to their potential relationship. The Late Iron Age and Early Roman activity was focused on two double-ditched enclosures recorded in the north and central parts of the site respectively. Both enclosures had associated field systems extending out on similar alignments. A Middle to Late Iron Age ring ditch thought to represent a roundhouse was recorded to the east of the southern enclosure and may be suggestive of earlier unenclosed settlement activity in this area of the Site. The medieval activity consisted of several charcoal production pits in the central part of the site. However, the artefactual evidence of medieval activity was very sparse and only represented by residual pottery found in a later post-medieval feature. Potential ridge and furrow indicated by the geophysical survey in nine trenches was found to be geological or pedological in origin. The post-medieval activity consisted primarily of field system ditches and correlated well with historic Tithe and early edition OS mapping. A cobbled surface and rubbish pit were recorded in the central part of the site and are potentially associated with demolished structures to the north, as depicted on Tithe map. Post-medieval and modern land drains were also recorded.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119282","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"wessexar1-513366_213387.pdf"}],"title":"Dean Hill Road, Willand, Devon: Archaeological Evaluation","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119282","docType":"report"}}
{"text":"Strip, map, record of two areas covering 1.6 ha In Area 1, the investigation targeted the remains of an Iron Age settlement discovered during the evaluation stage. Excavations revealed a rectangular enclosure with a central structure that contained an inner gully and a group of nine pits or postholes. The remains of another four roundhouse ring gullies were also revealed within the enclosure and a further external ring gully was located to the south-west of the enclosure. In Area 1, post-medieval or modern activity was represented by two large pits likely related to coal mining. One, a possible prospection shaft, contained a timber support frame. The other was timber lined and may have been a well. Only four features were revealed in Area 2 (a pit and three ditches), none of which contained any dating evidence. Overall, the results are stratigraphically simple, and the sequence is well understood. The highest complexity seen is multiple phases of two roundhouses in Area 1. The excavation generated a small assemblage with limited potential as the only datable material in the assemblage is post-medieval/modern and probably confined to the 19th/20th century. The animal bone assemblage held little potential as it consisted mostly of abraded or unidentifiable fragments. None of the identifiable pieces exhibited butchery or processing marks. The analysis of environmental samples from the central roundhouse has provided evidence for the cultivation and processing of crops.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119292","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"wessexar1-515034_210676.pdf"}],"title":"Northumberland Line Newsham Station.

{"text":"The methodology followed the Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) (Banfield 2022) (Appendix 3). All aspects of the fieldwork were conducted in accordance with the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists' Code of Conduct (CIfA 2022) Digital photographs were taken of all standing walls using a Cannon EOS 50 camera capable of 24.2 megapixels. Written descriptions were taken of the materials and the method of construction for the church boundary wall. All photographic work followed Historic England guide (2015). Three trenches were excavated in the location of the piers (Figure 3). Concrete was removed using a mechanical breaker, followed by hand excavation of the underlying deposits. These deposits were recorded onto pro-forma context cards. Sections were drawn at a scale of 1:10 and photographed using an appropriate photographic scale. The trenches and section locations were located in reference to plans supplied by the client. Finds were retrieved and bagged by individual context number. A licence to remove human remains was applied for, and granted on the 17th August 2022. The photographic survey has added to the information from an earlier survey carried out in 2012 (Johnson 2012) on the north-eastern and south-eastern boundary walls and the St Saviour’s churchyard wall. This was carried out when the north-eastern plot boundary wall was dismantled and replaced. The current photographic survey afforded the opportunity to record a part of the St Saviour’s churchyard wall which was obscured by a shipping container during the previous survey, and revealed possible wall and chimney scars apparent on the churchyard wall. These probably represent structural elements from the buildings backing onto the churchyard wall as depicted on the 1852 historic mapping. It is probable that the chimney and wall belongs to the building to the south-west of an internal courtyard. The area of the wall to the north-east was lower and topped by coping which perhaps suggests this was the back wall for the courtyard area. Similarly, the current survey took place when overgrown vegetation overhanging from the churchyard had been cleared, giving a much clearer and unobstructed view of the full extent of the wall. It has revealed extensive damage on the upper sections of the wall, probably as a result of the aforementioned vegetation. The trenches excavated in advance of the new foundation piers uncovered evidence for medieval deposits and structures. Wall (211), identified in Trench Two and possibly as (107) in Trench One could be the foundation for a previous boundary wall for the church. The archaeological deposits are likely to represent medieval soil or dumping, some of which may have derived from graveyard soil. This also explains the presence of disarticulated human remains, which are likely to have been removed alongside the graveyard soil and redeposited at the site location.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1108980","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"yorkarch3-511404_193295.pdf"}],"title":"Open Area Excavation, Photographic Survey at Wall repair at St Saviours Church","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1108980","docType":"report"}}
{"text":"Between the 1st of August and the 28th of September 2022 York Archaeology carried out a watching brief at Queen Street, York (SE 59612 51573). The site is comprised of York Station long Stay Car Park, around York RI building, a section of Queen Street, and part of York Station frontage. The work was undertaken for Howard Civil Engineering on behalf of York City Council in order to aid planning conditions under consideration by CYC (19/00535/FULM). The site was mostly made up of modern deposits including tarmac, concrete and levelling deposits. These were excavated via mechanical jack hammer, digger and/or vacuum excavator. Where in situ archaeological deposits were identified or present they were hand or machine excavated under archaeological supervision. Human remains that were encountered were left in situ where possible, but skeleton <1004> was removed in compliance with environmental health regulations and with a valid licence from the Ministry of Justice (APABE, 2017). The earliest archaeological features within the excavation corresponded to the Roman period. Two inhumations SK1/C1004 and SK2/C1011 most likely related to the large Roman cemetery known to exist under York railway station (Ottaway 2011). These burials were overlaid by Roman layer C1009, dated to the 2nd- 3rd century pottery. The nature of Roman activity on site therefore is predominantly of use for burials, which matches previous excavations in this area (OSA reports 98EV10, 99EX02). These earlier Roman deposits were most present in the highest area of site in the north/northeast, where archaeological deposits were shallower compared to the south/southwest where, due to deeper natural archaeological deposits, Roman activity was not detected. The medieval activity on the site appears to match known usage during this period, mainly agricultural in nature. Consisting of mixed deposits with pottery dating to mid-13th century as well as residual Roman pottery, they probably represent agricultural soil, as well as possible ploughing activity. The most interesting feature dating to the medieval period was the remains of a kiln or hearth C1043. This suggests small scale industrial activity happening during this period, possibly relating to the nearby Dominican priory or activity along Blossom Street. A surface of cobbles C2018, also dated to 13th century by pottery, suggests a possible surface or track way. The majority of archaeological deposits seen during the early ducting work at York station dated to, or relate to, the 19th century construction of the railway station or later. These consisted of modern made-ground and industrial waste, and were truncated by modern utilities, as expected within an urban location such as York centre. The remains of several brick structures/foundations were also uncovered within both trenches. These most likely relate to industrial use alongside the 19th century railway.","meta":{"id":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119961","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"yorkarch3-517323_221360.pdf"}],"title":"Archaeological Investigations at York Station Gateway, Early Duct Works","url":"https://doi.org/10.5284/1119961","docType":"report"}}
