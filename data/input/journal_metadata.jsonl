{"text":"The Historia de Sancto Cuthberto makes retrospective claims to lands granted to St Cuthbert and, in some cases, later taken from the church. Sections 8 and 11 refer to lands granted by King Ceolwulf (729–737) and lost around 860. Retrogressive technique is used to reconstruct the geography of these lands, within the widely accepted models of shire and minster organisation, drawing on post-Conquest feudal records. The circumstances under which these and other estates were taken from the church in the 9th century are discussed. It is argued that Lindisfarne’s territorial reach in Northumberland declined from a high point under a partnership between Bishop Ecgred (830–845) and King Eanred (c. 820s–850s) in the 860s in the face of the arrival of the Danish army and the collapse of the Northumbrian state. Some of the place-names of Historia 8 and 11 present problems of identification, where generic elements of the names have proved unstable.

Customs collections began in Newcastle in 1203; by 1604 a Custom House was recorded to the east of the Guildhall. The Custom House of 1767 was extended and refronted by Sydney Smirke in 1833, and expanded in the twentieth century to incorporate former brewery offices. It remained in use as a Custom House until 1998, and was acquired and renovated by Trinity Chambers in 2003. This article draws upon documentary sources to reconstruct the history of the Customs collection in Newcastle from the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries, and the ownership of the Custom House site from the fifteenth century to the present day.

{"text":"Archaeological investigations by ULAS in 2019, to the east of Pincet Lane, North Kilworth, revealed evidence for a range of activities, notably from the Middle Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age/Early Roman periods. In the Early Bronze Age, a circular palisaded enclosure (c.20m diameter) with a small entrance was constructed. In the centre was a crouched burial with the head orientated south-easterly towards the entrance. Further suspected burials or offerings were also found within the enclosure. Some of these had pots placed into the features, but no bone survived. Later, the entrance was blocked with two posts and the enclosure was redefined with a shallow ditch. A large (c.42m diameter) ring ditch, over 2m in depth, was excavated around the enclosure. The lower part of the ditch had naturally silted, whilst the upper part appears to have been deliberately infilled during the Iron Age period. In the late Iron Age, three roundhouses, and several enclosures, were constructed; some were dug into the top of the outer ring ditch. Evidence indicates one roundhouse was modified during the first century into a ‘C’ shaped enclosure; all of them were used into the Early Roman period. The locations of the Iron Age and Early Roman features suggests that by this point there was no trace of the outer Bronze Age ring ditch in the landscape. In contrast, all the features from this period respect the inner enclosure and the most likely explanation for this is that it was covered by a visible mound. An earthwork may have survived as late as the post-medieval period, as a later trackway may also be respecting this area.","meta":{"id":"3253315","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"2022_96_013-068_Huxley.pdf"}],"title":"Prehistoric Ring Ditches and Late Iron Age Activity at Pincet Lane, North Kilworth, Leicestershire","datePublished":"2022","publisher":"Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society","creator":["Huxley, Richard|Cooper, Lynden|Cooper, Nicholas|Johnson, William|Richer, Suzie|Santer, Adam|Small, Rachel|Speed, Gavin|Thomas, John"],"issueNumber":"Volume 96","isPartOf":"Transactions of the Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society","docType":"journal","publicationYear":2022}}

{"text":"In August 2020, investigation of a cropmark identified by landowners resulted in the discovery of a spectacular figurative mosaic on land on the eastern side of Rutland. Following the notification of the Leicestershire and Rutland Historic and Natural Environment Team, a programme of investigation was initiated, and University of Leicester Archaeological Services were appointed to record the trench with support from Historic England. A follow-up programme of geophysical survey, trial trenching and test pitting was implemented to establish the extent, nature and date range of the archaeology, and to assess the risk to the remains from the current farming regime – providing information that would ultimately lead to the designation of the site as a Scheduled Monument.The work has established the presence of an elaborate villa complex, encompassing eight buildings and a host of other structures, enclosed by a ditch system. The excavated areas produced evidence broadly dating it to mid-late third to the late fourth century AD, although there are hints of earlier activity. Unusually, the site has apparently survived as a substantially complete complex, encompassing the full range of buildings that would be expected in a Roman villa, in Britain and is therefore of national and regional significance. However, much of the archaeology was at a shallow depth and therefore potentially at risk from continued cultivation. The mosaic was within a probable dining room at the northern end of a large villa building with an apse, from where it would have been viewed. It depicts scenes from the story of the Trojan War cycle and, in particular, the conflict between Achilles and Hector at Troy. The legend is illustrated in three rectangular panels, each portraying a different act from the tragedy. The inspiration for the imagery is likely to have been taken from an illustrated codex, presumably provided by the proprietor of the villa, marking them out as a highly educated individual. The subject matter of the mosaic is unique in Britain and rare in the rest of the Roman Empire, and it has been described as the most important Roman mosaic to have been discovered in the last 100 years.","meta":{"id":"3253317","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"2022_96_079-094_Browning_et_al.pdf"}],"title":"The Discovery of a new Roman Villa and unique mosaic in Rutland","datePublished":"2022","publisher":"Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society","creator":["Browning, Jennifer|Masséglia, Jane|Taylor, Jeremy|Thomas, John"],"issueNumber":"Volume 96","isPartOf":"Transactions of the Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society","docType":"journal","publicationYear":2022}}

The city maintained its Roman walls into the medieval period, which made it a well-located and easily defended central settlement for Scandinavian settlers.

I had intended to include dating evidence, making it four-dimensional but, apart from the Domesday Book, there is scant evidence for the precise date of establishment of many of these settlements. The overall objective was to determine whether specific name-types exhibited any particularly characteristic patterning. The resultant analysis exposed some distinct patterns, not just in relation to the primary settlement study of worths but to other name-types, which may provide fuel for further research. For example, is it possible to deduce further meaning in addition to simple translations of the names? Do relative locations tell us anything about the organisation of the post-Roman/early medieval English landscape, its population types and the exploitation of its resources?

{"text":"Whilst the impact of bankruptcy has been investigated by Hoppit, his examination was confined to the eighteenth century, finishing at 1800. His analysis also represented the macro-level, the whole of England. It is important, however, to consider the effects of bankruptcies on local economies, with their different complexions. Bankruptcy is here related to structural change in textile production and financial services. Additionally, the exploration extends to 1842 when District Courts of Bankruptcy were introduced, replacing a previous system that had existed since 1706. A second aspect confirms a recent proposal by Paul that there was a downside to the ‘consumer revolution’: risk and anxiety. Paul’s evidence was derived from insolvent debtors – at the lower level of trading and commerce. Bankruptcy proceedings were restricted to those engaged in higher levels of financial transactions and debt; and so indicate higher levels of risk in the local economy.

{"text":"Recent excavations in Ewell revealed a palimpsest of archaeological remains that date from the Mesolithic to the Middle Saxon period. The first archaeologically identifiable evidence of activity within the confines of the site consists of scattered struck flint of Mesolithic and Neolithic date with more substantial activity occurring in the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age as evidenced by settlement activities associated with a well-organised field system. During the early Roman period, Ewell became the site of a large quarrying industry. That activity, and the landscape in which it took place, were of undoubted significance to the ancient inhabitants of the area, as demonstrated by the presence of a wealth of structured deposits in quarries and ditches that included a large quantity of human remains. The Romano-British people that were responsible for these depositions may have viewed the exercise as a practical undertaking integral to the quarrying process. Knowledge of the importance of this landscape and the earlier features within it appears to have survived into the post-Roman period when the top of one of the quarries was apparently used as a receptacle for a ‘deviant’ burial of Middle Saxon date. The results of this excavation therefore add to current understanding of the development of Ewell and its environs from the Late Bronze Age onwards and contribute to bodies of knowledge on several wider topics, including the nature of Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age pastoralism and settlement on the North Downs, late prehistoric flint tool production, Roman quarrying in south-east Britain, mortuary rites in this region during the Late Iron Age and Roman periods, the potential importance of landscape context and the concept of liminality within prehistoric and Romano-British cosmologies and the appropriation of the landscape by a new culture during the Anglo-Saxon period.","meta":{"id":"3242467","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"surreyac103_091-172_haslam.pdf"}],"title":"Quarrying, Structured Deposition and Landscape Appropriation in Ewell","datePublished":"2021","publisher":"Surrey Archaeological Society","creator":["Haslam, Alexis|Haslam, Rebecca"],"issueNumber":"Volume 103","isPartOf":"Surrey Archaeological Collections","docType":"journal","publicationYear":2021}}

{"text":"This hilltop in East Sussex which overlooks the English Channel was occupied for much of the time between the beginning of the third millennium B.C. and the sixth century A.D. Neolithic occupation is represented by a series of pits, one of which contained an interesting group of flint tools, with associated environmental evidence. There is then a hiatus with only slight traces of occupation in the Bronze Age. During the early Iron Age a small farming settlement was established near the crest of the hill. Unenclosed in its primary phase, it was later surrounded by a rectangular enclosure, outside which were fields. Excavation showed that the latter were cultivated intermittently from the Neolithic to Romano-British periods. The Iron Age structures were mostly of the four and six-post types. Occupation continued throughout the Romano-British period in the early part of which a rectangular enclosure was laid out. The fifth century A.D. saw the establishment of an Anglo-Saxon settlement of rectangular buildings and sunken huts, which covered part of the earlier settlement and spread out over the former fields. On the edge of the settlement was a contemporary cemetery. Each period has produced evidence of the environment and economy. Studies of land and marine mollusc assemblages are included, and an attempt is made to classify pottery and clay objects on the basis of their contained minerals and to pinpoint possible clay sources.","meta":{"id":"3242146","abstract":true,"identifier":[{"name":"file","value":"SAC_v115pdfa.pdf"}],"title":"Excavations at Bishopstone","datePublished":"1977","publisher":"Sussex Archaeological Society","creator":["Bell, Martin"],"issueNumber":"Volume 115","isPartOf":"Sussex Archaeological Collections","docType":"journal","publicationYear":1977}}
