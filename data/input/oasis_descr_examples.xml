<value columnNumber="1">The Excavation revealed a wealth of archaeological information. The earliest period was represented by residual finds of a Mesolithic worked flint axe in a medieval plough furrow and Bronze Age aurochs bone in an Iron Age pit. The Iron Age period consisted of several phases of a Banjo Enclosure with associated roundhouses, four-post structures, boundary ditches, pits and a quarry. In the early Roman period there was little activity other than quarrying, but later a farmstead was established with an agricultural system reminiscent of a vineyard. No evidence was recovered for the Saxon period, even as residual finds in later contexts, and thus it is assumed that the site was either unused by the population at that time, or subject to a regime that has left no trace in the archaeological record. In the medieval period a ridge and furrow cultivation system was established that cut across many earlier features but incorporated surprisingly little material from earlier periods. After the medieval period, the site appears to have been largely abandoned until Enclosure. The two phases of work took place between March - May 2000 and subsequently between August - October 2001 by CAM ARC, Cambridgeshire County Council (formerly the Archaeological Field Unit).</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation was carried out on land off Leicester Road, Uppingham, Rutland (SK 854 007) on the 8th-10th November 2005. This work was in advance of the proposed conversion of the land into a cemetery and the provision of car parking spaces. This work was carried out on behalf of Uppingham Town Council by University of Leicester Archaeological Services. A total of six evaluation trenches were excavated which revealed three undated linear features, the possible remnants of one medieval furrow, and a small Mesolithic - Neolithic flint assemblage.

<value columnNumber="1">Between 1st November 2009 and 8th February 2010 the Cambridge Archaeological Unit undertook an open area excavation on some 2.23 hectares on University land at the High Cross Site, West Cambridge. This excavation was undertaken prior to the development of these plots, which lay to the south of Charles Babbage Road; the latter to include the building of a University Sports Centre, accommodation and car parking facilities. The work was commissioned by the University of Cambridge Estate Management and Building Service (EMBS). The site consisted of three adjacent areas; Area A (0.86 hectare) lay on the south side of a small valley separated from Area(s) B and C (1.36 hectares) on the north side by a small brook/field drain. The centre of the site was located at grid reference TL 4240 5900, whilst the pre-excavation ground level varied from 20 m OD at the northwestern corner (Area C) to 16 m OD at the eastern end(s) of Areas A and B. Features (pits, pit clusters) and ditches were identified spanning the Late Mesolithic to Medieval period and included evidence of Iron Age metalworking and a large number of Iron Age quern stones.</value>

Three residual struck flints suggest only ephemeral activity in the area during the Mesolithic/ Early Neolithic period.    The earliest feature recorded during the Watching Brief was a grave containing disturbed human remains. A Roman date has been suggested for this feature.    Medieval activity was represented by a well, two pits and a posthole.    Post-medieval activity was represented by a well, two pits and three postholes.    A number of other features including a empty well contained no datable artefacts.    The majority of the area has been subject of heavy post-medieval landscaping which has truncated many of the features, most notably the inhumation, which survived to a depth of only a few centimetres.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation and watching brief was undertaken at a former petrol storage facility, Bath Road, Worcester (NGR SO 85200/52250). Archaeological evaluation demonstrated the presence of an Iron Age and Roman settlement. The petrol storage facility was built during the early years of World War II close to the River Severn. It comprised six large concrete tanks together with ancillary buildings including offices, stores, pumping houses and an air raid shelter. The archaeological evaluation comprised the excavation of eight trenches, five of which revealed archaeological features. Iron Age pottery and Roman pottery was recovered from several features. Archaeological excavation and watching brief of the site was undertaken in parallel with the demolition of the tanks. Several key areas were identified. In the centre of the site a cluster of pits was uncovered, three of which contained worked flint. The flint is thought to derive from a blade-orientated industry of Mesolithic or early Neolithic date. The presence of flint chips and a core showed that flint knapping was taking place on the site. At the southern tip of the site, the Iron Age ditch exposed in the evaluation was revealed to be an enclosure. Features within the enclosed area included five postholes, a circular storage pit, a buried Malvernian pot and a series of shallow gullies identified as drip gullies of a roundhouse. At the south-eastern edge of the site, a concentration of industrial by-products such as coal ash, clinker, slag and hammerscale was identified in the fills of a small ditch running down a slight slope and a cluster of pits. The presence of hammerscale demonstrates that smithing was taking place here.To the north west of this area, an Iron Age ditch and two Roman ditches crossed the site from east to west. These probably represent the edge of an enclosure constructed in the Iron Age and continued in the Roman period.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Trial trench excavations by Trent and Peak Archaeology in May 2018 on the Site of the former Broadmarsh Bus Station and Car Park found deposits and features dating to the Mesolithic, Medieval and Post-Medieval periods. Three trenches were excavated.    The medieval features are likely to represent boundary features associated with the Greyfriars, namely two well-preserved sections of wall that may represent the precinct walls of the Greyfriars, as well as deposits potentially associated with activity within the precinct walls. Presence of at least some medieval tiles from a high-status building may indicate a church or other structures associated with religious orders within the vicinity of the Site. However, given that only small sections of both of the walls have been revealed, their function, their relationship to each other and the sort of activity to which they relate are currently uncertain. Animal remains suggested possible light leather production within the Site, although the relatively small size of the assemblage and the lack of features associated with tanning within the trenches make this uncertain.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological surface artefact collection survey was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology in April and May 2009 at the request of Scott Wilson Limited on behalf of Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering Limited on land to the north of Hawton Lane as part of the A46 Newark to Widmerpool Improvement.     A small number of Mesolithic blades, bladelets and cores, including one blade of possible late Palaeolithic/Mesolithic date, was recovered although the numbers were not great enough to suggest a concentration or in situ scatter. The majority of the recovered worked flints were undiagnostic and could only be categorised as being broadly prehistoric in date. A small assemblage, totalling 12 sherds, of pottery dating to the Iron Age, Roman and medieval periods was recovered within the survey area. Little meaningful interpretation can be placed upon such a small assemblage except to note its presence.    Post-medieval and modern artefacts dominated the recovered assemblage, with pottery being the most commonly retrieved material.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The results of a 5% archaeological evaluation on a 43.4-hectare site on land south of the railway line and west of Westerfield Road, Ipswich, Suffolk (NGR TM 166 468) can be summarised as follows: Loose Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age flints may indicate some activity here in those periods. Two groups of parallel Middle Iron Age ditches (spaced 4-5m apart) formed arable field patterns in two areas. Two groups of Iron Age pottery and two curvilinear gullies (buildings?) indicate contemporary settlements. Weaving is indicated by loom-weight fragments.     Roman sherds in field ditches indicate a continuity of a small part of the Iron Age field system into the early Roman period. Roman pottery and ditches may mark indicate a small settlement. Fragments of roof tile and a tessera show that there was a high-status Roman building somewhere in the vicinity (beyond this site).    There was no evidence of Anglo-Saxon period activity. Two areas of medieval ditches in broadly in the same locations as the Iron Age ditches show medieval arable here. Associated settlements (low-status rural?) are indicated by pits and ditches.     The principal post-medieval and modern remains were a small enclosure with a small brick building, and field ditches (some shown on the OS as late as 1904, but since removed). Other remains consisted of 500m of WWII anti-tank trap and a gun pit, a waste pit associated with the former and adjacent 19th-century brickworks.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The Essex County Council Field Archaeology Unit carried out an archaeological excavation for the Salvation Army before rebuilding of the Salvation Army Citadel, 70 Baddow Road, Chelmsford, Essex.  The excavation was undertaken to supplement the earlier work that had recorded a Roman pit and a linear feature running east-west across the site, interpreted as a post-medieval hollow-way or a Roman Road.   Trench 1 in the south-west of the site recorded a mixed alluvial deposit containing large amounts of Roman rubbish, mainly pottery, dating to the mid-2nd to mid-3rd century, with a few sherds of medieval pottery representing later disturbance. Residual Mesolithic flint tools were also recovered.  This is consistent with evidence from the surrounding area, that the site lay in an area of rubbish disposal at the north-eastern limit of the Roman town, outside both the town defences and the extra-mural temple precinct.      Trench 2 in the north-east of the site investigated the post-medieval hollow-way and re-interpreted it as a relict channel at the southern edge of the flood-plain of the river Can, filled with alluvial deposits to a depth of at least 1.8m (2.45m below modern ground level).  There is no evidence for a Roman road crossing the site, and the main Roman road leading eastwards out of Chelmsford ran 90m to the south.  The pottery from the 1971 trenching was re-examined and, together with the pottery recovered in 2008, has dated the sequence of infilling of the channel to the 14th to 16th centuries.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The retrieval exercise proved successful and also highlighted the potential of the undisturbed areas of this site. The two Romano-British sherds are likely to have been associated with the cremation cemetery, which was only partially explored in 1850-1880 and may cover a large area. The recovery of an assemblage of Mesolithic flintwork and presumably contemporary fire fractured flints, shows that this sandy outcrop was a focus for activity during this period. This would have been an ideal location to exploit the resources provided by the sea, the River Ouse and the Seaford downland.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of the archaeological excavation carried out by Archaeology South-East on land immediately east of Farrington Farm Industrial Estate, Hoyle Road, Peacehaven, East Sussex    A small amount of residual flintwork was recovered spanning the Mesolithic to later prehistoric periods. The earliest features on the site are a pair of short Late Bronze Age field boundary ditches.    The main phase of activity identified on the site is from the Middle Iron Age and comprised a sequence of ditches representing the junction of two droveway routes. A number of postholes representing potential buildings or fence lines, and small midden deposits are also dated to this phase of activity.    The presence of Roman pottery within one of the droveway ditches suggests that the transport routes were still in use at this time at a reduced intensity, and it is known that Roman activity in the wider landscape is also much reduced, being focussed on a small settlement enclosure directly to the north of the site. A small group of pits identified close to this enclosure are thought to be associated with its occupation.    The site appears to have fallen out of use after the 1st century AD and there is no further activity until the post medieval period when three undated field boundary ditches are thought to have been used. These were identified as post medieval by stratigraphic relationships and shared orientation with post medieval features in the wider landscape.</value>

The evaluation was commissioned by Pure Lake New Homes Ltd in advance of the proposed redevelopment of the site for residential use. The trial trench evaluation was undertaken in response to a brief issued by EH GLAAS.    The desk-based assessment identified known find scatters of Mesolithic, Roman, medieval and post-medieval date in the area surrounding the site. Evidence of settlement activity from any archaeological period is however not represented in this part of the Cray Valley, owing to poor survival and/or a lack of fieldwork.     The archaeological evaluation comprised three trial trenches, which revealed four modern features associated with the construction and subsequent demolition of the building that previously occupied the site (Trenches 1 and 2). The previous demolition and site clearance activity in the eastern part of the site (Trench 3) had also caused the truncation of the ground level to the natural sand and flint gravel layers.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The examination of the watching brief sections and the window samples and boreholes from previous phases of work has enabled the characterisation of the subsurface deposits across the site, and provided a basis for the understanding of the evolution of the landscape from the Late Glacial to the present day. The work illustrates the complex nature of the landscape as a progressively inundated land surface, with periods of hiatus, as water level rose, as a result of relative sea level change, during the Holocene. The surface of the Pleistocene deposits forms the basic topography for much of the Holocene. An area of high gravel (a gravel island) was found to the east of the site and a low area of gravel, representing the route of an early Holocene channel was recorded to the centre of site. The gravel island would have remained high dry ground for much of the Mesolithic and early Neolithic and would have been an ideal base for past humans to venture out from and exploit the rich marginal wetland resources.    The broad stratigraphic units found on site were basal sand and gravels; fluvial sands banked around the gravel island; organic clays and silty sands representing sluggish flow and pools of standing water in the area of low lying gravel; peat deposits representing a wooded wetland again concentrated in the central area of low lying gravel; increased sedimentation and the formation of fine grained minerogenic mudflats; overlain by wooded peat deposits; and finally alluvial silts and clays. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Three trenches covering an area of 350.2sqm were opened in the environs of Earith's Civil War earthworks known as the Bulwark. The trenches were opened across the distinct landfall of a terrace edge that was thought to have once framed a former channel of the River Ouse. Quarrying identified in two trenches immediately south of the Bulwark may hold some broad contemporary connection to Civil War activities, with 17th century pottery coming from one of these. A full sequence of sediment deposits was recorded from the later Holocene to the historic era. Items of Mesolithic to Middle Iron Age attribution dominated the finds recovered from these trenches, predominantly coming from sealed 'buried soil' contexts as well as a ditch dated to the latter of this time frame. A third trench was positioned north of the Bulwark to investigate a raised linear anomaly thought to represent the course of the Roman Car Dyke. This was found to be a silt and alluvium filled roddon that passed through a deflated boggy environment, and although no sign of the dyke was forthcoming this may have been either removed or obscured by a later channel broadly following the West Wash flood deposits.</value>

The evaluation was required by the local planning authority (Great Yarmouth Borough Council) in advance of the submission/ determination of a planning application for residential-led development  based on advice from Norfolk County Council Historic Environment Service. The fieldwalking recovered a total of 113 pieces (2085g) of struck flint.  The assemblage includes part of a flaked axe, scrapers, blades and debitage of mixed prehistoric date and technology, ranging from the Mesolithic to the later Neolithic/early Bronze Age.  The flint cores and tools from all prehistoric periods are broadly distributed in the southern, western and north-western sectors of the site.  The bulk of the assemblage comprises debitage or waste flakes with limited diagnostic potential but their distribution again reflects the worked flint being located in the western, southern and northern sectors of the site.    A single sherd (20g) of late Bronze Age to early Iron Age pottery was recovered from Find Spot (FS) 145 on the far western side of the site.

<value columnNumber="1">In May 2005, Archaeological Solutions Ltd conducted an archaeological desk-based assessment of land at Great Amwell, near Ware, Hertfordshire.  The site is located on the western edge of Great Amwell, between the village and the A10, c.1.25km south of Ware and c. 1.5km east of Hertford. It overlooks the Lee Valley, which passes the site c.1km to the east and north east before sweeping westwards.  The site is bounded to the east by the Van Hage's garden centre and  lies on the western edge of the East Hertfordshire District Area of Archaeological Significance 181, which comprises the medieval core of the village of Great Amwell.    There are no recorded structures or finds of archaeological or historical interest within the site. However, the surrounding area has yielded Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Roman finds.  In addition there are Iron Age or possibly Early Bronze Age earthworks to the south east, and the village of Great Amwell is known to have been in existence since the Norman period.       The site has been used for arable agriculture since 1766, at the most recent, and this type of land use may extend even further back. Quarrying has occurred within close proximity to the site but this does not appear to have ever encroached into the study area. Therefore, the most likely cause of any disturbance of deposits will be due to agricultural practices such as ploughing.  Colluvial deposits are likely at the base of the slope of the site.      </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A geoarchaeological investigation was undertaken by Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) on the site at 2 Pier Road, North Woolwich, London E16. The work comprised four boreholes, revealing a Quaternary sedimentary sequence of Pleistocene floodplain gravels overlain by Holocene interbedded mineral alluvium and organic/peat strata capped by made ground.   Subsamples were taken from one borehole, BH03, for radiocarbon dating and pollen, plant macrofossil, ostracod and micropalaeontological assessments, revealing a series of environmental changes from the Mesolithic period to the Roman period and later.   In the Early Holocene in-channel sandy silts formed on the site, with brackish foraminifera indicating a period of early estuarine influence at the site. Later in the Mesolithic, a freshwater marginal wetland formed at the site surrounded by dense broadleaf woodland.   The first evidence for human activity near the site is reflected in early Neolithic pollen assemblages which indicate both a decline in elm woodland and cultivation in shifting 'landnam' type clearances - the first time this kind of shifting cultivation has been positively identified in the London area.   Later in the Neolithic an alder carr woodland formed at the site, which persisted throughout the later prehistoric period. Whilst pollen shows increasing woodland clearance on the surrounding dry land, the on-site environment gradually became wetter and under increasing estuarine influence as a result of rising relative sea level. By the Roman period, as sea levels continued to rise, the on-site alder carr eventually gave way to estuarine mudflats which persisted until the modern period.</value>

The channel contained artefactual material dating from the Mesolithic XXX to the XXX, most notably XXX, indicating it was open and receiving material for a considerable length of time. The evaluation also identified a spread of calcined flint, mixed in a 'greasy' charcoal rich sandy matrix, located adjacent to the palaeochannel in the north-eastern corner of the site. Although this feature was not fully defined in the trench and had been affected by later activity, it is plausible that it represents the partial remains of a 'Burnt Mound', a type of (commonly Bronze Age) monument commonly found adjacent to water sources/ in wetland environments.

The stratigraphy found at the North Woolwich and Intervention Shaft sites consisted of peats and silty clays (dating from the Mesolithic period onward), overlying gravels and capped by inorganic clays. At the Woolwich Arsenal Station site made ground was found to overly Thanet Sands directly. Pollen analysis found possible evidence of cereal production that was likely to have taken place within a few hundred metres from the Intervention Shaft site, though not on the site itself. Diatom analysis provided clear indications of the changing riparian environment including indications of sea level changes over time.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation was conducted for Norfolk County Council ahead of soil stripping prior to the construction of the contractors' compound for the Northern Distributor Route, known as the Broadland Gate. This involved the excavation of 33 50m long trial trenches. Seventeen of these trenches contained archaeology; two of these had been placed to coincide with known cropmarks, and one of these certainly located a ditch in the correct position to be this cropmark. Other trenches also contained ditches, many of which were aligned north-south and east-west, with one or two on different alignments, possibly of a different date. Some of the ditches show continuations across the site. The dating for the ditches is difficult, with few artefacts having been discovered.   Other excavated features include a single post-hole, several pits, and natural features. The dating for all of these features is also sparse. Flint artefacts dating from the Mesolithic to the early Bronze Age were recovered from some of these features, along with a few tiny fragments of prehistoric pottery.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between June 2005 and February 2008, Archaeological Solutions carried out two stages of archaeological investigation on land adjoining 80 Wisbech Road, Littleport, Cambridgeshire (NGR TL 5608 8732), in advance of residential development.  The site encompassed part of the former Fen edge on the north side of Littleport 'island'.    The investigations revealed three phases of activity, focused on the higher, drier southern part of the site.  Scattered struck flint indicated sporadic activity during the early Neolithic (Phase 1), when this area was probably dry.  In the late Bronze Age/ early Iron Age (Phase 2), numerous shallow pits, some containing pottery and occasional daub fragments, suggest the site lay within paddocks on the periphery of a settlement further to the south.  Peat growth in the north of the site was well-developed by this time, having begun around the middle Bronze Age.  Remains of two ditches, the larger of which ran down into the fen, suggest that similar agricultural land use continued into the late Iron Age (Phase 3).  Part of a ?curated Mesolithic/Neolithic quartzite pebble hammer was found in the upper fill of the larger ditch, close to its terminus.  This might represent a deliberately placed 'votive' deposit.  Its deposition may have been associated with the rising water table, which was causing flooding on the site around this time and probably led to its abandoment soon after.  column samples contained well-preserved pollen evidence for later prehistoric environmental change and agriculture in this part of Littleport.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">This project takes the form of a desk-based assessment, to examine the relationship between the historic environment and beach replenishment schemes, by exploring deposition of archaeological material on replenished beaches and their former offshore contexts. The Mablethorpe to Skegness coast has been used as a case study. Analysis has revealed that the Mablethorpe to Skegness coast has a high potential for survival of archaeological remains dating to all periods. In particular, it has potential for Prehistoric and Roman remains. It has also been shown that there is potential for the survival of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic remains in the vicinity of dredging areas 107 and 440, although the probability of such remains being disturbed during dredging is thought to be low. Analysis of coastal processes indicates that any derived archaeological material is likely to be found on the upper beach, where the coarse material from areas 107 and 440 is redistributed to. If such finds are made in an area where post-replenishment erosion is known to be low, then the probability that they have originated from an offshore context increases. Should such finds be made in an erosion hotspot, however, where the beach sometimes erodes back down to the clay substrate level, the probability decreases. This is because it would be virtually impossible to differentiate between pre-existing and derived Prehistoric remains under such circumstances. The study concludes that there is a low risk for the redeposition of archaeological deposits from the North Sea floor onto the beaches between Mablethorpe and Skegness.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">In February 2005, Archaeological Solutions Ltd conducted an archaeological desk-based assessment at the Site of the Former Fruit and Vegetable Market, Hylton Road, Worcester, WR2. An archaeological evaluation was conducted on the site in 2001 by the Archaeological Service for Worcestershire County Council.  The evaluation recorded mostly modern activity on the site, in the form of structures, dump layers and possible quarry pits. Alluvium layers were recorded across the site, associated with the changing water depths. One of these deposits contained a single Mesolithic flint tool and Roman pottery, although these are unlikely to have originally deposited on the site. The alluvium layers have the potential to preserve important environmental remains.    The assessment established that the main focus of settlement has occurred on the east bank of the River Severn, while the west bank was only developed in relatively recent times. This judgement is supported by other evaluations and watching briefs in the area which have not recorded any remains pre-dating the post-medieval period.     World War 2 defensive structures have been identified in Worcester by the Defence of Britain project, and the results of this survey have integrated into the Historic Environment Record. The survey revealed the presence of a road block on the assessment site, consisting of two large concrete cubes by a gateway (WCM 92171).  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The fieldwork followed on from the previous evaluation carried out in 2002. The work envolved a watching brief and sampling of the palaeoenvironmental sequence uncovered in various interventions across the northen part of the site. A deep sequence of peat and fluvial deposits were recorded which represented the former courses of ancient channels, which flowed through the area during the Late Glacial to early Holocene period (c. 10,000 to 7,000 BP). Carbon dating on the Boreal peat horizon produced a date of 9,200 BP. Although very little evidence was found for human occupation in the form of flint artefacts, the deposits contained high levels of pollen and plant remain preservation, and are therefore significant for reconstructing the Late Glacial environment within the Upper Colne Valley.    A  test pit was also excavated on the southern part of the site along the line of a proposed flood relief channel. Over a gravelly sand horizon, representing a former dry landsurface adjacent to a channel course, an asemblage of over 3000 insitu flints, with another 6000 recovered from the 100% sampling program were recovered. The scatters were also associated with red deer and pig bones. The scatters covered an area c. 15m x 5m, within which four distinct scatters were identified  suggesting more than one phase of activity. Charred hazelnuts associated with the scatter were carbon dated to 9,300 BP, suggesting an Early Mesolithic date for the scatters. The flint assemblage consisted of burins, scrapers, microliths, and serrates. The site has significance for not only understanding Early Mesolithic hunter-gather behaviour, represented by the flint scatters, but also the environment within which they operated. The site is also significant due to its close proximity to Three Ways Wharf 200m to the south, where extensive flint scatters of a contemporary date were also excavated.</value>

Roman brick and tile were found in sparse quantities in the eastern half of the site.  The earliest pottery found is late medieval and comprises a few sherds, again sparsely distributed.     The site did not have a specific archaeological potential, largely due to the lack of previous archaeological interventions.

<value columnNumber="1">  A Community Archaeology project was organised by Archaeology South-East. This report provides the results of the fourth season of archaeological investigation of a 3.7ha field called Little Stiances, located at Sharpsbridge Lane, Newick, East Sussex. This work was carried out in June 2019.    Geophysical and topographic surveys carried out in 2010 confirmed the location of a 'lost' cottage known from cartographic sources and allowed the targeting of test-pits at that location in 2010, 2013 and 2016. Other target areas identified during those surveys, including house platforms and a sunken routeway, were investigated in 2013 and 2016. In 2019 test-pits were again located at the site of the cottage and garden, and on either site of the identified routeway.    Unfortunately work at the site was somewhat curtailed by poor weather, but as in previous years, the 'Cottage Site' produced a variety of finds reflecting the occupation of buildings in that part of the field, mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Finds ranged from elements of the fabric of the building to pottery, clay pipes and domestic items such as buttons.    Test-pits located to the north of the sunken routeway showed a marked concentration of medieval pottery, strongly suggesting the presence of medieval occupation fronting onto the sunken way leading from the road towards the cottage site. A platform to the south of the route, presumed to be the site of a building produced little material.    The recovery of  the usual background scatter of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork from the site highlights the use of the general area by Hunter/Gatherers, and continued to stretch the site's chronology back into prehistory.  </value>

The site is located on the western edge of Great Amwell, between the village and the A10, c.1.25km south of Ware and c. 1.5km east of Hertford. It overlooks the Lee Valley, which passes the site c.1km to the east and north east before sweeping westwards.  The site is bounded to the east by the Van Hage's garden centre and  lies on the western edge of the East Hertfordshire District Area of Archaeological Significance 181, which comprises the medieval core of the village of Great Amwell.    There are no recorded structures or finds of archaeological or historical interest within the site. However, the surrounding area has yielded Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Roman finds.  In addition there are Iron Age or possibly Early Bronze Age earthworks to the south east, and the village of Great Amwell is known to have been in existence since the Norman period.       The site has been used for arable agriculture since 1766, at the most recent, and this type of land use may extend even further back. Quarrying has occurred within close proximity to the site but this does not appear to have ever encroached into the study area. Therefore, the most likely cause of any disturbance of deposits will be due to agricultural practices such as ploughing.

The excavation was commissioned by CgMS Consulting in advance of a proposed residential development on the site. A previous archaeological evaluation, undertaken by Birmingham Archaeology in 2007 (Bishop 2007) had identified evidence of settlement activity in the form of ditches, gullies and pits dating from the Early to Middle Iron Age.     The excavation uncovered evidence of small scale, temporary encampments during the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, as well as settlement evidence, in the form of boundary and enclosure ditches, pits and postholes dating from the Early-Late Iron Age. The evidence suggests a small scale settlement being established during the Early Iron Age with expansion during the Mid-Late Iron Age, with the centre of the main settlement being located to the east of the site. The settlement was most likely moved to the south and / or east during the Romano-British period with the features revealed during the excavation forming part of the settlement limits.

Test-pits located to the west of the sunken routeway showed a marked concentration of medieval pottery, strongly suggesting the presence of medieval occupation fronting onto the sunken way leading from the road towards the cottage site. A platform to the east of the route, presumed to be the site of a building produced little material.    The recovery of  the usual background scatter of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork from the site highlights the use of the general area by Hunter/Gatherers, and continued to stretch the site's chronology back into prehistory.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report has been prepared at the request of the developer, to cover a programme of archaeological investigation that forms part of the development of a plot of land situated adjacent to New River Court, London Road, Ware. The site is located in the valley of the river Lea at Ware. An examination of two series of geotechnical boreholes from the site demonstrated that the site crosses the line of a palaeochannel that was considered to have the potential to preserve environmental indicators including waterlogged organic material, pollen and macrofossils, which, in turn, might be expected to provide a broad-based environmental sequence for the Lea Valley across an identifiable timeframe. On this basis, a further series of boreholes was commissioned with the aim of collecting cores from which appropriate samples could be extracted. Only the most organic sediments and the clayey silts overlying them in the sequence have preserved pollen, and preservation falls off rapidly below the humified organic silts, resulting in little more than 10-15cm of sediment preserving pollen that is potentially countable. The pollen evidence appears to suggest a hiatus between the organic silts at 136-137cm and the clayey silts above at 127-128cm depth. The latter were interpreted as sediments resulting from overbank flooding, and a band of coarser silts at 130-13 could represent an erosional event and account for a hiatus in the sequence at this point, although other factors could also be responsible for a hiatus. The change in habitat from a lime dominated woodland in the late Mesolithic to a much more open landscape in the sediments a few centimetres above is marked, but these upper sediments lack dateable organic remains, although a post-lime decline date in the 2nd millennium BC might be suggested from the pollen.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeology South-East was commissioned by Kier Construction to undertake a programme of archaeological work in relation with the alteration to existing buildings and construction of new buildings at the Seaford Sixth Form College, Seaford.     The site represents a palimpsest of Early Holocene activity. The grid excavation has revealed an Early Holocene land surface that consists of a sandy deposit with equivocal boundaries. This deposit - sealed by a possible colluvium - has been disturbed by anthropogenic and natural factors, but it contains a significant quantity of prehistoric finds; principally lithics (unburnt and burnt) but also some pottery. The prehistoric finds are essentially Mesolithic and Neolithic in date, but a few Early Bronze Age pieces were also recovered. A pit and two less-well defined pits were found. It is difficult at this stage to date and interpret pit [19] with confidence, but it could be Neolithic and its assemblage could represent a placed deposit.     The first horizons encountered during machining below the tarmac and crushed chalk consisted of humic sandy loam topsoil and silty sand subsoil. They contained a wide array of non-prehistoric finds. Their dispersal and poor condition suggest that the area was possibly used for arable purpose. Some finds are also likely to derive from further up-slope. In preparation for the grid excavation the site had been under-stripped down to the possible colluvium, and the assemblage of non-prehistoric finds was therefore recovered from the possible colluvial deposit and as intrusive from the underlying palaeosoil. The earliest of these finds dated to the Late Saxon period.     Of great interest is the preliminary method used to untangle the mixed assemblage of prehistoric finds and better understand the taphonomic history of the site.   </value>

Material from the Romano-British period offers the first evidence of identifiable activity in the form of ironworking waste. However this assemblage was undoubtedly imported to the site in the post-medieval period, and although it was unequivocal evidence of the industrial activity known to have been widespread in the Weald at that time and in later periods, it did not relate to activity actually at the site.    Evidence of medieval activity was somewhat enigmatic, represented by a limited assemblage of often highly abraded sherds of pottery, usually recovered from provably later features, and two features tentatively dated to this period. It is more-than-likely that all of the medieval material recovered from the site was residual, and that this location on the fringes of the medieval village remained unoccupied at that time.    However, there was clear evidence of an upsurge in activity at the site after 1500, A number of pits were dug at the site over the next two or three centuries, as well as a shallow gully, presumably for drainage. A limited assemblage of domestic material was deposited in these features.    Physical evidence for the use of the site as a tannery dates to the 18th and 19th centuries, when the site also appears to have been sub-divided with ditches, again also acting as drainage. Some domestic material was also deposited in pits at this time. A block of tannery pits were active at this time, occupying much of the site; there are cartographic and documentary references to the presence of a tannery/fellmongery at the site at this time, and for the location of buildings.  </value>

The ditches evidently formed boundary and/or drainage features within an agricultural landscape, although the absence of other features and the dearth of artefacts both indicate that there was no nearby occupation. The radiocarbon dating for the large southern ditch (100 BC to AD 70) supports the idea of continuous  agricultural activity from the later prehistoric to Roman periods, as previously suggested from excavations on the site of the Villa.

Geotechnical survey of the site prior to housing development demonstrated the presence of Pleistocene and Holocene (post-glacial) sediments resting on the chalk basement lithology.  Because of the waterlogged nature of the sediments and the importance of Palaeolithic and early Mesolithic archaeology in the region, this site was perceived as having potential for palaeo-environmental reconstruction. Consequently, a borehole survey was carried out to examine in detail the stratigraphy and obtain samples for pollen and diatom analysis from which information on past vegetation and environment could be obtained.  A series of 10 boreholes were recorded to obtain the sub-surface profile and obtain samples for pollen and diatom analysis. Two sediment profiles found in basal depressions were sampled for pollen analysis from which two pollen diagrams have been constructed. However the sequences are of later than anticipated age being possibly middle to late Holocene (Atlantic/Neolithic) in Borehole 4 and ?medieval in Borehole 8. Pollen preservation is poor with evidence of differential preservation and also sparse with low absolute pollen frequencies recorded. This is attributed to calcerous ground water. Borehole 4 has demonstrated a vegetation environment dominated by woodland of lime, oak and hazel on the interfluves and alder on the wetter floodplain. Borehole 8 of ?medieval age shows an open habitat with few trees, possibly grassland with some evidence of cereal cultivation.</value>

The study area is located within a rich archaeological landscape with evidence existing from the Mesolithic to the post-medieval periods.   Although no archaeological remains or artefacts were uncovered during the investigations, useful information on the depth of overburden within this area was recorded.  The postholes that were excavated have established that any archaeological features cut into the river terrace will be sealed by c.1.50m of overburden (topsoil and subsoil/alluvium).    This is likely to have protected any surviving archaeological remains from moderate modern disturbance.  This is illustrated by the presence of brick rubble in postholes 2, 4 and 5, at a height well above the river terrace.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation comprising trial excavation was undertaken on a small area of open ground adjacent to Grey's House.  The immediate area contains evidence of human activity extending from the Mesolithic to the post-medieval period.  Nearby is the site of Kempston Manor, which has revealed evidence of Saxo-Norman structures and boundaries.  Previous investigations in the area have also exposed substantial dumps of modern material, which were used to raise the level of the ground.  A single trench was opened revealing between 0.4 and 0.55m of compact dumps of modern building debris immediately below a shallow topsoil and turf horizon. Directly below these dumps was undisturbed natural strata.  This would indicate that as part of a construction programme, probably associated with the building of the school, the ground level was reduced to the undisturbed natural strata</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Work on new underground cable and excavation for four transformers was monitored between September 2008 and June 2009, by G Rapson for Museum of London Archaeology at Loseley Park, near Guildford Surrey.    The majority of the cable was laid by mole-plough resulting in minimal excavation. In addition to the excavation work, a local ploughing competition presented an opportunity to field walk several areas adjacent to the cable trenches      Six archaeological features were recorded.   Excavation in Sunnydown, in a natural dip in the topography at the junction between the chalk and clay geology, revealed a buried layer containing Bronze Age pottery, burnt flint and occasional worked flint. The presence of burnt flint visible in the surrounding ploughed fields suggests an extensive area of prehistoric activity, possibly associated with a natural spring.    In the Polstead Lodge area, located on a gravel terrace, four undated field ditches, two of which are probably of modern date, were recorded and ploughed fields provided evidence of prehistoric activity, in the form of occasional burnt and worked flint pieces.    The remains of an undated flint structure was recorded on the western edge of the large ditch, located south of Conduit Farm. The feature may relate to field buildings or an earlier drainage feature.    Occasional Mesolithic flint pieces were observed in the topsoil on West Warren ridge and also in E-W sandy track to the north of West Warren. Three sherds of Roman pottery were also recovered from the track north of East Warren.       </value>

Cropmarks associated with prehistoric features and Roman artefacts have been located nearby. Fieldwalking undertaken on the fields associated with the open cast mine prior to their excavation has yielded prehistoric artefacts from the Mesolithic through to the Neolithic period. The early 19th century maps of the site also show buildings on the northern part of the site, the remains of which may be located by trial trenching.  A total of four trenches were placed on pasture on the northern part of the site and within the farm itself. No archaeological features were discovered within four of the trenches and the trench placed within the area of the farm revealed heavily disturbed ground and a large amount of made-up ground.   Trench 02, placed on pasture to the north-east contained a linear feature of unknown date and origin. The feature was filled with colliery waste and so is likely to be fairly modern in date.  </value>

The assessment was commissioned by Forge Architects in advance of the redevelopment of the site for residential use.  There are no recorded structures or finds of historical or archaeological significance within the site. There are however, several such sites in close proximity to the study area.  Evidence of the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic is scarce in the Battersea area. The Bronze Age is comparatively well represented. There is evidence for Roman activity in the area, but little is known about the precise form of any settlement.  Due to the importance of the Thames as a route of communication the settlement of Battersea was mainly clustered along the banks of the Thames on the stretch of river known as Battersea Reach, and along Battersea High Street to the north-east. High status occupation in the medieval and post-medieval periods is attested at York House to the west. The area of the assessment site, however, appears to have been located in the agricultural hinterland of the settlement until the large-scale Victorian industrialisation and suburbanisation of the area.  The site will likely have been much affected by the Victorian and later development of the area, by bomb damage and clearance after WWII and by the construction of the Winstanley Estate in the 1960s.</value>

The archaeological evaluation was to form part of a required Environmental Statement to be submitted prior to the determination of proposals to extend the existing sand and gravel working at Tyttenhanger Quarry.    The evaluation involved the excavation of 128 trial trenches over an area of 84 ha. A large number of features were identified. However, many contained no finds and are thought to represent natural hollows or variations in the drift geology rather than man-made landscape features. The evaluations also found a small number of prehistoric, Iron Age and Romano-British features, principally pits and ditches, located in three main concentrations. Activity on site during these periods seems to have been small-scale and probably agricultural in character, rather than reflecting intensive occupation. Preservation of features and finds was poor due to extensive plough damage. The Iron Age and Roman archaeology is of some local significance, but has little to contribute to wider research agendas.    Residual later Mesolithic/Neolithic worked flints, including an obliquely-blunted microlith, a finely-made broken blade and part of a leaf-shaped arrowhead, add to the known picture of earlier prehistoric occupations attested at adjacent sites along the Colne Valley.</value>

A Mesolithic worked flint and a few sherds of earlier Neolithic and later Neolithic / earlier Bronze Age pottery (most of which were residual finds in later contexts) suggested transitory use of the site in those periods.    The earliest evidence for settled occupation of the site dated to the later Bronze Age and was represented by the remains of two roundhouses, several square or rectangular buildings or structures, pits, postholes and external hearth deposits. The settlement was apparently unenclosed; an undated ditched track or drove-way to the north of the main area of occupation might have defined the limit of the settlement at one time. It is likely that the settlement extended beyond the area of excavation to the west.    Artefactual and environmental evidence suggests that this was a purely domestic site; there is no conclusive evidence for industrial activity. Cereal crops were used, but it would appear that these were not processed on site. The large later Bronze Age pottery assemblage is of regional significance.    The settlement was abandoned during the later Bronze Age and buried by wind-blown sand. A ditched track that truncated one of the roundhouses is not dated conclusively but might have been the continuation of a Roman track found previously to the east of this site.    There is no conclusive evidence for the use of the site in the medieval period, although a possible hollow way might have formed at that time. Some post-medieval ditches can be related to field and parish boundaries shown on 19th-century maps.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">August 2006. Oxford Archaeology carried out an excavation in advance of the erection of an antennas ant the installation of supporting infrastructure. The work revealed evidence for Mesolithic use of the immediate vicinity in the form of redeposited flint tools. Later prehistoric use of the site was suggested by worked flint and pottery ranging in date from late Bronze Age to Iron Age. These sherds were recovered from three parallel ditches/gullies aligned N-S across the site. A small amount of medieval pottery was also recovered from one of these features, where a possible re-cut was noted although this was not clear. None of these features can be securely dated as the pottery was of a small quantity and abraded and may well have been residual. Thirteen postholes were revealed, some of which formed a linear alignment, perhaps once a fence line. The fence line appears to have post-dated the ditches. Only one post hole contained pottery, which was of Iron Age date. This was accompanied by a small amount of metalworking debris. Several plough scars were identified but remain undated.</value>

The site lies between the earthwork remains of the Deserted Medieval Village of Hamilton, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and a large area of modern housing development, where previous archaeological work has encountered substantial archaeological remains dating from the Mesolithic to the Roman periods. Archaeological remains encountered in four of the trenches suggest that the site was part of the agricultural hinterland of Iron Age and Romano-British settlements already recorded during the development to the west of the site. Ditches interpreted as field boundary ditches produced finds ascribed to the mid- to late Iron Age and the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD, while a few small, discrete features, including a pit that appeared to have been used as a hearth, suggested that further agricultural or peripheral activities had taken place. The site otherwise displayed only the furrows created by medieval strip cultivation, which can be ascribed to the open fields of the medieval settlement of Hamilton.  </value>

The proposed development lies on the periphery of the Roman settlement at Ware. The latter straddles Ermine Street. Previous excavations at GSK have excavated the Roman vicus, or small town, which grew up along the Roman road of Ermine Street in the years following the Conquest of 43 AD. The settlement appears to have comprised industrial and domestic activity together with a possible shrine or temple sited on the course of the road, and extending some way into back plots. The concentration of Roman burials, on the east and west sides of the small town delineate the limits of the settlement. Numerous investigations at GlaxoSmithKline have helped define the Roman settlement, as well as locating more limited evidence for prehistoric activity from the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Iron Age.    Cartographic evidence suggests that the assessment area was relatively undeveloped until the early 20th century. It remained as two large fields, with only malthouses occupying the south-eastern sector, as depicted on the 1st Edition 1878 OS 25' map. It was not until the construction of Allen  and  Hanbury's factory in1899, and its subsequent expansion as Glaxo UK, and more recently GSK, that the site was subject to major redevelopment. A watching brief carried out during the construction of a new water tank on the development area did not reveal archaeological remains and up to 2m of made ground was recorded. It is likely that archaeology, if present, will only survive as 'islands' between areas of modern disturbance.</value>

Downham is situated on a slightly raised north-western promontory of the Isle of Ely, above the low-lying former fen.  Prehistoric activity from as early as the Mesolithic is attested to around the village, although evidence of permanent prehistoric settlement is scarce at present. Downham developed from Anglo-Saxon origins into a valuable manor held by the abbey and later bishopric of Ely, and the modern street grid may represent an early planned layout.  The site has potential for remains of Anglo-Saxon and medieval toft boundaries, buildings and evidence of associated activity.  In addition, inhumations thought to represent an Anglo-Saxon cemetery have been found close by and more burial remains, with the potential to shed light on the origins of the village, may lie within the site.   Buildings present in the south of the site since the late 19th century are likely to have caused some truncation in this area, but archaeology in the rest of the site may stand a good chance of survival.

Trenching in the southern extension area revealed an alluvial based environment with the anomalies highlighted from an earlier geophysical survey corresponding to variations in the natural deposits. Deep alluvial subsoils, up to 1.2m deep in places, indicate that up until comparatively recently, when the land was drained, that the area was within the floodplain of the River Ure and, therefore, not suitable for human occupation. No archaeological features or deposits were identified in the southern extension area.  In sharp contrast the trenches in the northern extension area identified evidence of multi-period human activity dating from the Mesolithic, through the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Ages to the Romano-British period. Features identified include a pit alignment, enclosure and ditched boundary as well as pits, post holes and areas of burning. The widespread distribution of the features suggests that almost all of the terrace at one time or another has been utilised by human communities.

Excavation in the 1970s, in advance of gravel extraction, provided limited evidence of Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age activity prior to occupation in the later Iron Age, when the enclosure was established. Pottery and briquetage indicate trading links with the wider region, respectively with west and north Worcestershire, and with Droitwich. The main Iron Age occupation is dated from the later 2nd century to second half of the 1st century BC. By the 3rd-4th centuries AD the site was apparently cultivated, as small quantities of Romano-British pottery were scattered across the site, probably as a result of manuring arable fields associated with a nearby, but as yet unlocated settlement. Similarly in the medieval and post-medieval periods a thin scatter of finds in the overlying soils indicated further agricultural activity.    Analysis and reporting on the 1970s archive has enabled the potential of this site to be realised, so that it can now contribute to ongoing research into Iron Age sites in the region, especially in relation to those situated in an aggregates landscape. In addition to updating the original structural and environmental evidence the report includes new finds reporting and a fresh overall discussion, which draw attention to the significance of the earlier prehistoric activity and to the distribution pattern of the Iron Age finds on the site.  </value>

The Launch Chamber forms the North Woolwich entrance to a tunnel under the Thames adjacent to the King George V docks. The centre of the site lies at National Grid reference 543497,180148.    The nature of the sediments was logged and environmental samples were taken through a section of undisturbed sediments. Most of the site to a depth of approximately -2.5mOD consisted of disturbed sediments thought to be deposited across the area during the excavation of the King George V docks. Samples were taken through selected deposits and were analysed lithostratigrapically and chronostratigraphically. The stratigraphy found at the Launch Chamber site consisted of two bands of peat and silty clay (dating from the Late Mesolithic period to the late Bronze age), overlying gravels. These results correlated well with previous investigations in the vicinity.    The watching brief has provided an outline, in combination with other geoarchaeological investigations in the area, of the changing palaeoenvironment during a pivotal period in prehistory. The integration of the results of the Watching Brief within a planned publication on the DLR extension as a whole will help to provide a more detailed picture that might enable the nature and timing of human activity in the locality and its relationship to the evolving floodplain environment to be better understood.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Excavation and monitoring work in advance of the construction of a new Consolidated Communications Building at RAF Lakenheath has identified a low density of occupation dating from the Mesolithic and up to probably the post-medieval period.   However most of the activity is ephemeral and difficult to interpret.  A fairly sterile soil layer overlying Bronze Age features, may relate to a similar finds-rich deposit found within 30m of this site, but if so, this area must be beyond the focus for the Iron Age to account for the absence of occupation debris within the soil layer.  Windblown sand and parallel gullies probably demonstrate the presence and effect of medieval and post-medieval farming on the landscape.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation comprising 18 machine cut trenches was carried out by John Moore Heritage Services in advance of clay extraction by the Michelmersh Brick and Tile Co. Ltd. The work produced a relatively small assemblage of knapped flint likely to date to the Upper Palaeolithic or Mesolithic periods (45000 to 10000 and 10000 to 4500 BC). A later prehistoric component was noted in the flint assemblage, which is consistent with assemblages from various stages of archaeological work to the west of the brickworks. Finds of Late Iron Age and Roman pottery were also recovered, though mostly from superficial contexts. The only features tentatively dated were a pit containing late Iron Age to early Roman pottery, and a ditch which produced a small pottery assemblage dating to the later 3rd to 4th century AD. A number of narrow ditches were recorded, which though un-dated seem likely to be part of a late prehistoric to Roman field system, probably contemporary with the settlement previously recorded on the western side of the brickworks. The only other finds were small amounts of post-medieval pottery and CBM (ceramic building material), which was mostly recovered from topsoil and sub-soil contexts.</value>

The excavation covered an area of 1.5 ha. The excavations uncovered substantial remains of early to middle Iron Age and early Anglo-Saxon date, with more limited earlier prehistoric, Roman, medieval and post-medieval evidence. In all periods, the site has been an open, grassy floodplain, and the use of the site has been structured by the line of the river Cam/Rhee to the west and the underlying geology of chalk in the west and gravelly clay to the east.     The earliest features dated to the later Neolithic or Bronze Age (Phase 1), and comprised a small barrow, discrete pits, and (generally residual) Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age struck flint.  </value>

The site is the subject of an on-going approved development including part conversion of existing buildings and redevelopment to residential usage.   No archaeological features were encountered from the Site during the current fieldwork. No finds predating the post-medieval and modern periods (1500 - present) were recorded. However, the number and spread of interventions recorded archeologically on the Site, both in an earlier geoarchaeological borehole survey and the current fieldwork observation and sampling, should enable a greater understanding of the chronology of sedimentary sequences in this part of the Colne Valley, where other sites are known to contain nationally important evidence of Late Glacial and Early Mesolithic human activity, including the nationally and  internationally important site of Three Ways Wharf c. 50m to the south-east.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">In Autumn 2008 a programme of archaeological excavation was undertaken  at Titnore Lane, Goring-by-Sea.  The excavation was conducted across the full area of the 2.2 hectare site.    A wide range of periods were represented on site, incorporating the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Romano-British, medieval, and later post-medeival activity. The features and finds assemblage associated with the Mesolithic and Neolithic were limited, representing only a periodic use of the site. The key feature associated with Mid to Late Bronze Age activity was a c.3.5m wide trackway identified as running north-south across the site. By the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age period the first evidence of settlement was identified, formed of a roundhouse, pits and a possible livestock corral. The Mid to Late Iron Age period saw a growth in settlement with several phases of roundhouse construction associated with boundary ditches, pitting, further possible corrals and  the creation of an artificial pond adjacent to the settlement. The settlement had disappeared by the 1st century AD replaced by a series of field boundaries and rubbish pits thought to part of the villa complex known immediately to the south of the site. Romano-British activity did not survive beyond the early to mid 2nd century. A large enclosure and field boudary were found on site dated to the 12th to 14th century. Post-medeival and modern activity were limited on site. Overall, a high density of archaeologicaly significant features were identified during the course of the excavation from a wide range of periods.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between November 2006 and March 2007 the Cambridgeshire County Council Archaeological Field Unit (CAM ARC) carried out an archaeological excavation on the land at New Road, Chatteris. Two areas, covering a total of 0.7ha were opened. Area A was situated to the north of the partition wall that subdivided the development area whilst Area B lay to its south. Evidence for human activity spanning the Mesolithic to Medieval periods was recovered, although features directly associated with settlement appeared to date predominantly to the Iron Age and were concentrated toward the southern end of Area B. These comprised boundary ditches and gullies, pits and a very large number of postholes, some of which were concentrated into clusters that appeared to represent the sites of repeated construction, probably of fairly temporary structures. Three cremations dating to the Middle Bronze Age were recorded in Area A. Two inhumations also recovered from Area A were tentatively dated to the Roman period. A number of sherds of Saxon pottery were recorded across the site but of particular significance was the recovery of a sherd of imported North French Blackware. This was an extremely rare find in the county, with Chatteris being just the third site to produce such material. This pottery is thought to have had strong associations with the wine trade and it may therefore be that during this period Chatteris formed a staging post for travel and trade throughout the region.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An evaluation was carried out by Wessex Archaeology on land to be redeveloped as industrial warehouses. The site lies in the Lower Colne valley, an area identified as having high potential for the preservation of significant Late Upper Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic environments and in situ remains of human occupation.   Four machine-dug trenches were excavated but no archaeological features were found. Only one artefact, a heavily rolled and abraded piece of worked flint, a core rejuvenation tablet of possible Neolithic date, was recovered. A significant sequence of Holocene alluvial deposits dating back to near the Last Glacial maximum was recorded, however. The sequence was sampled for palaeo-environmental analyses and radiocarbon dating. The recorded pollen and sedimentary sequences are typical of other early post-glacial (pre-Boreal, Boreal and Atlantic) sequences reported in the vicinity and show a typical sediment sequence of alluvium and tufaceous deposits, peat and alluvium. These start in the Late Devensian/early post-glacial period. Peat formation starts at around 8340 - 8040 cal BC, at the pine maxima and the rise in hazel. This is accompanied by high levels of macroscopic charcoal and may relate to some charred macro-remains of dock in the same sequence.   Given the absence of direct evidence of human activity at the site, interpretation of the results of the palaeo-environmental analyses is difficult. However, the pollen assessment shows major zones of microscopic charcoals which probably represent human activity of early Holocene date nearby. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The site identified Late Neolithic Grooved Ware pits, one of which contained an elaborate and apparently nationally unique collection of artefacts and environmental remains. A Bronze Age burnt mound and associated features were also recorded in addition to an early 8th century AD well associated with flax processing. Two Romano-British graves were also discovered, although the acidic nature of the soil had eroded the bone leaving only hobnails, an iron bracelet and pottery fragments.   The most significant features were five Late Neolithic pits, one of which contained an elaborate collection of six whole and fragmentary polished axes, numerous flint tools and debitage, significant quantities of Grooved Ware pottery and abundant charred barley grains and crab apple fragments. Radiocarbon dating of charred cereal grains and crab apple pips from within this pit has provided a date of 2900-2600 cal BC. The Grooved Ware assemblage, a mixture of Durrington Wall and Clacton Styles, is the largest to have been found in Worcestershire and the collection of six axes from one feature is unique for Britain. One of these axes is at present not provenanced and may have been created from a source material located outside of Britain.   Palynological evidence from a palaeochannel dated to the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic (4690-4450 cal BC) through to the Early Bronze Age (2290-1910 cal BC) has also provided a regional sequence of landscape change.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An electromagnetic (EM) survey was conducted over land at North Park Quarry, Bletchingley, Surrey. The project was commissioned by Sibelco UK Ltd with the aim of establishing the presence, or otherwise, and nature of detectable archaeological features. More specifically, the survey was targeted towards the detection of burnt remains, which may relate to early prehistoric activity at the site. During earlier archaeological evaluation, a Mesolithic fireplace was located. An electromagnetic survey was conducted to support the further excavation by helping to locate potential remaining burning spots. The survey forms part of an ongoing programme of archaeological works being undertaken in support of a planning application for the extension of industrial sand extraction. The survey was successful in detecting several anomalies that may indicate potential burning spots within the survey area. Several of these responses were similar to a known fireplace, which was located at the centre of the site. However, due to the ongoing archaeological investigations on site their interpretation is tentative as they could equally relate to disturbance caused by this more recent activity. </value>

The excavation was located within a topographic basin which had resulted in the accumulation of groundwater and consequently the formation of a gley soil.  Modern building material comprising brick, concrete and stone had been deposited within the basin in order to firm up the soft ground within this area of the site.  A single flint artefact, believed to date to the Mesolithic period, was recovered from subsoil deposits.

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeological excavations undertaken during 2006 at Priors Hall, Corby, Northamptonshire revealed evidence of a former late Iron Age industrial landscape. During the excavations nine well-preserved iron smelting furnaces were excavated dated to the late Iron Age.  Preservation of these furnaces has enabled the traditional chronology of metallurgy during the late Iron Age-early Romano-British period to be challenged as well as allowing further elucidation of the techniques of early Iron production in Britain.     Prior to the industrial exploitation of the landscape, Priors Hall appears to have been visited by transient groups between the Mesolithic and early Bronze Age periods, with a sparse distribution of pits and reused tree throws dating to these periods. It is likely that at this time the site would have been wooded with what is now known as Rockingham Forest extending across  swathes of the landscape. It was the presence of woodland, along with the natural ironstone outcrops, that  gave rise to an iron producing landscape from the late Iron Age onwards. There are over thirty iron smelting sites known  in the present Rockingham Forest area. Only a few of these sites are thought to date to the late Iron Age, with many of the sites undated, making the Priors Hall furnaces of some significance.     The onset of the early Romano-British period saw the construction of the Little Weldon Roman villa and an apparent shift to a more agricultural landscape, although it is possible that some of the furnaces were operational at this time too. </value>

An early Iron Age site was recently discovered just to the south of this site (CAC 035) and scattered Prehistoric finds are recorded on the county Sites and Monuments Record in the area.  The site is also just to the east of Bloodmoor Hill, an area with abundant archaeology including an Anglo-Saxon settlement and cemetery site.  Five trenches were excavated over the development area, and were stripped to the level of the natural subsoil. Four of the five trenches produced no archaeological evidence.  Trench 4 however, had a buried soil horizon with scattered flints of Mesolithic to Bronze Age date, as well as some probable Iron Age pottery found in association with a small burnt area, a possible domestic hearth, within this soil horizon.  Occasional flint flakes were also found in the top and subsoil within this trench.  This evidence is of a similar age to that found at the adjacent CAC 035 and suggests a small area of prehistoric activity.

The Main Sewer  and Trench 4, revealed a natural stream channel of late Mesolithic date   To the south revealed a Roman ditch , It produced Roman pottery and a coin dated to AD 181-192, and ran perpendicular to the former course of Akeman Street suggesting it may represent a boundary of a remnant field system.    To the east, groundworks revealed a medieval chalk structure, prompting a small open excavation. The base of two co-joining chalk-lined kilns possibly for the production of lime, were recorded, and six small associated pits, a ditch and a gully.  These features were overlaid by a layer of silty sand horticultural soil. Where the overburden was sufficiently reduced during groundworks, traces of this deposit were also revealed further up the slope to the south. The presence of horticultural soil deposits dated to between 1550 and 1700 sealed the Roman ditch  suggesting agriculture may have continued into the first half of the post-medieval period. Four brick walls with flint foundations were revealed along the site's Berkhamsted High Street frontage possibly pertaining to 19th century tenements.  The Main Sewer Trench revealed an organic soil layer, which contained remnants of planks and joinery waste and a 19th century glass bottle, possibly from the dumping of waste from the 19th and early 20th century sawmill and joinery workshops.  </value>

A prehistoric site, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, medieval and post-medieval sites have been located mainly to the west of the development area. Initially four exploratory trenches 20m x 2m were excavated, using a JCB mechanical excavator to a depth of 0.30-0.40m to the natural reddish brown Northampton Sand ironstone and clay substratum. Archaeological deposits and Roman pottery were noted in all of the four trenches. In view of this the remainder of the area which was to be impacted on by the proposed development was stripped by machine to the natural substratum, totalling of 1751 square metres. On further inspection of the stripped area, it was noted that although Roman pottery was present throughout the area, the site had been extensively quarried for the ironstone in the early to middle part of the 20th century to a depth of 1.00m-1.50m, leaving a north-west to south-east spine of 632 square metres of unquarried ground. This area included a network of ditches and gullies, two probable structures, pits and post holes of Iron Age and Roman date. In the north-eastern part of the area, an early Mesolithic flint scatter was located. Roman wall plaster and flue tile suggests the site lay near to a Roman villa.

One trench was located within the interior of the 'fort' and one just outside it to the southeast. The trench to the southeast of the 'fort' revealed pits, ditches and part of a possible round house dating to the Durotrigian Late Iron Age. The trench within the interior of the 'fort' revealed a dense sequence of archaeological features. Three small features produced a sparse scatter of Mesolithic flint. Late Iron Age occupation is represented by a series of irregular ditches and pits, probably industrial rather than domestic in function. The Roman military features include a number of small slots and a scattering of postholes and small pits. Later first century AD activity comprised a complex series of intercutting curvilinear ditches and pits, together with a possible hearth, which may be associated with salt working. Early 2nd century occupation was represented by a boundary ditch running NW-SE. The final phase of activity is represented by an inhumation burial aligned roughly N-S with the head to the west and a shallow pit containing disarticulated human bones, which may be associated with burials found to the north of Blandford Road, tentatively dated to the third century AD.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A programme of desk-based assessment was undertaken to determine the archaeological implications of proposed development on land north of Gaul Road, March, Cambridgeshire. An assessment area of 500m radius from the centre of the proposed development site was examined.    The location of the proposed development site is of topographical and archaeological significance. Geological and soil mapping of the area has suggested that during the prehistoric periods the site lay on the edge of March 'island', with a small extension of the surrounding fen protruding into the site.    Early use of the site is attested to by the presence of Mesolithic and Neolithic flint scatters in the northwestern and soutwestern corners of the site. A further scatter of flints was indentified in the southwestern part of the site during recent fieldwalking (report forthcoming).  These scatters may represent the remains of small transient groups moving across the landscape rather than more permanent settlement. Several prehistoric settlement sites have been recorded on March 'island' and in the surrounding area.       There is no indication of any later activity at the site. In the northern and western parts of the site remains could be buried beneath alluvium associated with either the realignment of the River Nene or the deposition of sands and silts during phases of marine incursion during the Neolithic period.  Cartographic evidence suggests that the development site has been  agriculture/pastoral land since at least 1680.  </value>

During the geoarchaeological evaluation of this part of the site an alluvial deposit was identified which contained a large amount of worked flint from a distinct horizon within the alluvium. The flintwork was dated Neolithic-Early Bronze Age.   During the archaeological mitigation the same sequence as was encountered as during the evaluation, 0.8m of made ground over c.0.5m of alluvium. It was this alluvial unit that contained all the artefacts, however no structure or distinct horizons were visible in the alluvium.   The lithic material recovered from the alluvium was in a fresh condition and does not seem to have moved far. Overall it has been assessed as being Mesolithic-Neolithic-Early Bronze Age. The pottery has a later date of late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age date, suggesting at least some mixing of material.  It seems likely that the material has moved from a site closer to the river bank, but the quantity of stone tools and their minimally abraded nature suggests they have not moved far.  Due to the ferruginous nature of the parent geology, the Folkestone beds, the deposits sampled proved to be completely decalcified and did not preserve palaeoenvironmental evidence.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An evaluation was undertaken by Wessex Archaeology on the site of a proposed housing development. Six trenches were excavated, revealing the former edge of the floodplain of the River Little Ouse running noth-west to south-east across the site. The natural topography of the area was altered by infilling in the pre-Roman period by natural ?windblown sand and the construction of The Warrener public house and car park. A thin scatter of flint of probable Mesolithic date was recovered, overlying natural on the edge of the floodplain. On rising ground to the south was a network of shallow ditches interpereted as Romano-British field or plot boundaries. These are likely to have been associated with a settlement immediately to the south. No Early Saxon or Middle Saxon features or finds were present and it is assumed that the limits of these known settlements lay immediately to the south of the evaluation site, with occupation strung out along the terrace above the floodplain, covering much the same area as earlier, Romano-British occupation.</value>

University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) were commissioned by Mr Adderley to carry out the archaeological work. A previous evaluation by ULAS has revealed a number of small discrete features, which were mostly undated apart from a small number of flints dating from the Mesolithic period.   The excavations were carried out by a box grader until archaeological horizons were reached at which point the upper soils were slowly stripped using a JCB with a flat bladed bucket. A number of small discrete features were revealed along with parts of two small ring ditches. Only a single find, part of a flint knife, was found during the work.  The decision was taken by the client not to excavate further and so the features were not excavated and were covered in geotextile material before being reburied.  The ring ditches were most likely Neolithic-Bronze Age in date, but the Mesolithic flint from the evaluation and the fact that one of the ring ditches appears to cut another feature may indicate a multi-phased site.  </value>

Although the Roman deposits had been significantly truncated by later quarrying, the presence of frequent, discrete areas of preservation allowed for the  identification of at least two phases of settlement activity/layout, with evidence for  landscape management in the form of ditch re-cuts. A substantial number of possible clay quarry pits were tentatively dated to the Medieval period.

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological watching brief was carried out at land off Gadley Lane, River's Vale, Buxton, Derbyshire, between March 2004 and October 2005.  The site was thought to have potential for the presence of archaeological remains and artifacts due to its close proximity to Mesolithic and Neolithic archaeological sites.  It was also possible that Roman remains might be present, as Buxton (Aquae Arnemetiae) was an important spa town during this period.  No archaeologial features, deposits or significant finds were recorded in the foundation trenches for the new buildings.  This may indicate that either the site was not the focus of human activity, earlier than the 19th century, or disturbance caused by the previous use of the site as a depot had removed any evidence of earlier activity.

<value columnNumber="1">The earliest feature was a large palaeochannel (probably a former branch of the Thames), which occupied much of the south-east half of the site. It was mainly filled with fine-grained sediments, some of which were organic and dated by radiocarbon assay. The earliest deposits were dated to 19480-19039 cal BP. Other sediments were similarly dated to the Neolithic, Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age and Late Saxon. Most evidence for human activity was in the north-west half of the site. The earliest artefacts comprised 61 residual struck flints dated from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age and part of a Late Bronze Age gold bracelet . The excavations provided a transect across a Roman landscape. Two phases of the London-Silchester Roman road were revealed next to the modern London Road. The earlier road was flanked by a ditch and later by a fence. Evidence for Roman occupation on the SE side of the road, clearly represented part a linear settlement that, as previous excavations have shown, extended alongside the road into what is now the centre of Brentford. The evidence included the remains of two substantial timber buildings that had burnt down bread ovens, hearths, pits and gravel surfaces. Successive Roman field systems defined by ditches lay between the settlement and the channel. The ditches also defined a track running down from the settlement to the channel. One ditch contained a human skeleton, and a crouched burial lay in a small grave next to another ditch. Roman artefacts included pottery, fragments building material, two shale armlets, a sandstone palette, fragments of lava quernstone, pieces of glass vessels, iron objects (a stylus, a hipposandal, cleavers, the bowl of a ladle), a lead weight and three bone pins. Copper alloy objects included a large number of coins, several cosmetic or medical implements, fragments of brooches, a bracelet, a hair pin and a fine circular seal box lid.

Potential  food plants recovered included a fragment of hazel nutshell and occasional burnt rhizomes. Lithics of  various kinds were also recovered during sample processing. This assemblage concurs entirely with the  interpretation on site of an early prehistoric lithic working site, potentially of later Mesolithic date.  Charcoal could have been from fire fuel or structural panelling, or both. AMS dating of single fragments  of identified charcoal recovered from the samples examined will assist in the confirmation of the age of  that period of occupation. The uncarbonised seed assemblage indicates a sandy, ruderal environment  extant today. One carbonised (probable) corn marigold seed may be a contaminant reworked from a later  period. The sample from Blasthill was devoid of any carbonised remains and so cannot aid in the  interpretation of that site in any way.</value>

Pleistocene gravels are overlain by sands of probable Late Glacial or Early Holocene age. The date of these sands is uncertain and needs to be ascertained as Mesolithic archaeology might lie below, within or at their surface.     A strategy for archaeological evaluation is proposed which targets for trial trenching areas where the earlier barrack buildings have been identified (two trenches) and parts of the inferred prehistoric land surface (two trenches). To investigate the wetland at the eastern side of the site which will be removed during excavation it is suggested that a trench be excavated across the area of impact. The impact of the piling on the wetland could be evaluated by four purposive geoarchaeological boreholes. The archaeological potential of the wetland deposits in the B2 level basement area might also be mitigated by a watching/stopping brief during ground reduction.  </value>

Overlying the natural was a mid greyish brown, silty sand sub-soil up to 0.50m; in sieving the subsoil a small quantity of flints, some possibly Mesolithic struck flint and some early medieval pottery sherds were recovered.  This sub-soil had been subject to truncation by drain trenches and features added to and subsequently removed from the garden during numerous alterations to its layout.    Three wall remnants were observed in the trench, which are also associated with alterations to and features within the gardens.

A significant quantity of Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic material derives from findspots within 200m to the south and south-west of the site, including a few examples of Upper Palaeolithic long blades.  Fifty test pits were excavated across the site and followed by 15 trial trenches in order to assess the site for significant archaeological artefacts, horizons and features. A large majority of the test pits and evaluation trenches encountered modern disturbance associated with the construction and demolition of the former hospital.  A small number of features predating the hospital were discovered in both the test pits and the evaluation trenches.

Ground level was generally between 54.71-54.82m OD, and the natural, a mottled, orangey brown, mixed sand deposit was observed from 53.58m OD.    Overlying the natural was a mid greyish brown, silty sand sub-soil up to 0.50m; in sieving the subsoil a small quantity of flints, some possibly Mesolithic struck flint and some early medieval pottery sherds were recovered.  This sub-soil had been subject to truncation by drain trenches and features added to and subsequently removed from the garden during numerous alterations to its layout.    Three wall remnants were observed in the trench, which are also associated with alterations to and features within the gardens.  Likewise, a thin spread of mortar and rubble, which butted a further spread of orangey gravel, may have formed the bedding for paved path and a garden path respectively.  These features are likely to be late post-medieval, most probably18-20th century.    The east of the trench was heavily disturbed by modern, intrusive features containing a rich, humic soil, many plant roots and other remains and large plastic tubs; these indicate the planting and removal of trees or shrubs in one of the most resent garden alterations.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of the 'Dig and Sow' programme of excavation of 27 1m square  archaeological 'test pits' in the Bedfordshire town of Potton in the spring of 2012. The  excavations were part of 'On Landguard Point' an arts project funded by Arts Council  England via its 'Artists taking the Lead' programme for the Cultural Olympiad of the London  2012 Olympic Games. Over a single day, nearly 30 people took part in the excavations in Potton which produced thousands of finds and provided new evidence for the development of settlement in the area from the prehistoric period onwards.    The prehistoric activity in Potton was mainly in the form of flint tool production potentially  from the Mesolithic period onwards with small scatters of lithics recorded from the test pits  along the Potton Brook. No Roman or Anglo Saxon finds were recorded but a number of  medieval finds were recorded as the village grew after the Norman Conquest. The Black  Death made potentially only a slight impact on the settlement, but the village survived and  grew into the town that can be seen today through the post medieval period.  By successfully involving members of the public of all ages and backgrounds from within,  across and beyond the community of Potton in planning, organising and undertaking the  excavations, the 'Dig and Sow' excavations enabled participants to find out more about  their local heritage, take part in the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad and enjoy a community  event while generating new evidence to inform understanding of the past development of  their homes, their community and its wider landscape.</value>

This excavation expanded on the results of this prior evaluation and identified significant settlement activity comprising timber framed buildings of probable wattle and daub construction that were dated from the 10th - 14th centuries and provided evidence of the origins of the late Anglo-Saxon settlement of Kilmeston. This was transitional settlement activity which continued on into the early-mid medieval period.  This settlement activity was in turn sealed by a late medieval to post-medieval ploughsoil horizon, which suggested that this settlement activity was replaced in the 14th century by agricultural activity on the site.  The excavation also identified a single pit which yielded a large assemblage of Mesolithic worked flints, which also suggested early prehistoric archaeological activity in the vicinity.  </value>

The works identified widespread archaeological deposits despite the shallow depth of archaeological levels and disturbance from the sites former landuse as a pine plantation. Limited early activity in the Mesolithic/Neolithic and Bronze/Iron Age periods was identified, but the bulk of the evidence related to a widespread phase of Late Iron Age/Early Roman activity in the 1st century B.C to 1st century A.D. This activity appears to have consisted of a ditched enclosure system associated with a probable agricultural farmstead, with a range of linear ditches and isolated or loose scatters of pits indicating a broad spread of agricultural fields, enclosures and trackways.    Although there were was no clear indication of structures upon the site, perhaps due to truncation and tree disturbance, the finds and environmental assemblage suggests the presence of domestic occupation, butchery and cereal processing in the immediate vicinity.    The settlement focus with which the site is associated appears to have ceased or shifted after the Late Iron Age/Early Roman transition period, perhaps to an area of 2nd-4th century occupation in the fields to the south, and it seems that the site became marginal or rarely used land beyond the periphery of this later settlement.   </value>

Three pits and a possible ditch contained varieties of flint, often very small, including worked and burnt flint fragments all indicative of a prehistoric date. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from four of the pits suggests that most, if not all, were of Iron Age date.

<value columnNumber="1">The archaeological excavation was undertaken ahead of the construction of a water main on land to the east of Dyke Village, north of Bourne. Analysis of aerial photographs, fieldwalking, geophysical survey and a desk-based assessment had suggested that the field in which the excavation was located had a high potential for the presence of Iron Age and/or Roman-British remains. In order to lessen the impact of the construction on the archaeological remains the route of the water mains, and therefore the excavation area, skirted the eastern and southern boundaries of the field. The excavation encountered evidence of prehistoric and Romano-British activity at the site. The limited assemblage of worked flint from the site suggests that it was used sporadically from the Mesolithic to Bronze Age, probably for hunting and perhaps grazing of animals later in the period. More intensive use of the site began during the early Roman period, probably in the later 1st century AD, when fencelines and a possible building were erected at the site, probably related to agricultural activity. During the 2nd century the land was reorganised and partitioned into small enclosures or fields, orientated approximately E-W to form a brickwork pattern. The earlier buildings were also replaced, possibly by sill beam constructed buildings. By the late 2nd or early 3rd centuries the small enclosures and buildings had fallen into disuse and been filled in and the area had been partitioned by a series of NE-SW orientated ditches which most likely formed much larger enclosures than the earlier enclosures. No significant remains were encountered which post-dated the 3rd century.</value>

Large oak tree trunks were preserved in the peat and tree tring analysis established that their last year of growth was 966 BC.  They were probably from a single stand of trees which was engulfed by the peat that was forming as a result of rising water levels. E nvironmental analysis and radiocarbon dating shows the area was largely cleared of woodland by the Late Bronze Age with some evidence for pastoralism on the site    Beneath the peat was an in situ prehistoric land surface of sand which produced 785 pieces of struck or modified flint, including 14 microliths and three end scrapers.

An archaeological desk-based assessment has been prepared by CgMs Consulting Limited (Darton 2007).  The assessment indicated the site had moderate potential for Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, low to moderate potential for Palaeolithic and post-medieval periods, and low potential for later prehistoric, Roman, early medieval and medieval periods, (Darton, 2007).  Despite its archaeological potential only post-medieval and modern remains were present.    The evaluation revealed an 18th -early 19th century brick wall and its associated construction cut.  Wall W1004 was located on the eastern side of the site aligned roughly east-west and extending towards Garratt Lane.  It was most likely to have been a boundary wall between either 63-64 or 64-65 Garratt Lane.  The OS Maps dated AD 1868, AD1893, and AD 1916 depict a boundary wall in this location to the rear of the properties that bound onto Garratt Lane (Darton 2007).</value>

<value columnNumber="1">In March 2007, Archaeological Solutions Limited (AS) conducted an archaeological evaluation of land west of Dartford Road and Phillips Chase and south of Elliot Road, March, Cambridgeshire (TL  4113 9698) in advance of the proposed construction of eight new residential dwellings.    Based on spot finds and flint scatters found in the area, the desk-based assessment found potential for archaeology dating between the Mesolithic and Romano-British periods.  In the north of the town, extensive evidence of agricultural activity from the late Bronze Age to the Roman period has been discovered.  Medieval settlement was located around St Wendreda's church c.1.5km south-east of the site.  The settlement gradually extended northwards in the post-medieval period.  19th and 20th century maps show the site in use as gardens/orchards, with a few small outbuildings.    The evaluation revealed twenty archaeological features consisting of eight ditches, five quarry pits, a small pit, one brick-built outhouse with its construction cut, one quarry pit/ditch, two uncategorised features and an area of modern disturbance.  Dated features comprise a late Bronze Age/early Iron Age pit, two medieval ditches, post-medieval quarry pits, a post-medieval ouothouse and two post-medieval tiches.  The medieval ditches, dating to AD 1150-1500, constitute interesting evidence of medieval land division in the area, but the small associated finds assemblages do not indicate intensive activity at this time.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">In April 2008, North Pennines Archaeology Ltd were commissioned by Wardell Armstrong LLP to undertake a sixty-six trench evaluation on land off Muston Road, Filey, North Yorkshire (NGR TA 111 800).  The fieldwork took place between 2nd-25th April, following an application for a proposed new residential development by Persimmon Homes, on land to the east of Muston Road. Previous work on site in the form of geophysical survey had been performed by North Pennines Archaeology Limited and the evaluation targeted anomalies detected in that survey, as well as 'sterile' areas where the geophysics failed to pick anything up.  The objective of the evaluation was to determine the presence or absence, nature and extent of any archaeological anomalies within the proposed development area.  The prehistoric pottery found in sealed contexts within the evaluation trenches dated exclusively to the late prehistoric, specifically the pre-Roman Iron Age.  Environmental analysis also revealed the presence of certain plant fibres indicating the potential of the site for rope making or similar activities during this period.  The presence of the lithics as well as the late prehistoric archaeological features such as the potential roundhouse in Trench 54 indicate the presence of continued human activity on the site from the Mesolithic through to the later prehistoric, the pre-Roman Iron Age.  Parts of the site are of archaeological importance and any removal of or disturbance to the features and or deposits should be mitigated through excavation or preservation in situ.  </value>

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green. The late medieval to post-medieval industrial past of the region was represented by an iron smelting bloomery furnace, three early brick clamps and ten kilns, for lime-burning or other functions, excavated in Lower and Upper Wharfedale.</value>

Nineteen trenches were targeted on the area of proposed development, and two on proposed ponds within a Sustainable Wetlands Area south and south-west of this. The north-eastern part of the evaluated area was higher and drier, the natural gravel dropping off to the south and south-west. Alluvium was found over the gravel along the north and south edges of the area. Most of the higher area had also been covered by recent dumping, raising the ground level by over 1m in places. The only evidence of prehistoric activity found was a single flint flake or blade, probably of Mesolithic or early Neolithic date. An inhumation burial of a child of 6-10 years contained one iron nail, suggestinga Romano-British or early medieval date. The burial appeared to be isolated, although not all of the area surrounding the grave was stripped.  Post-medieval ditches on various alignments were found in seven trenches, and undated ditches in a further four. The remains of a leat constructed of chalk and timber, and with what appeared to be a second leat running off to the south, were found in Trench 12 towards the south edge of the evaluated area. This is interpreted as a head main or top channel of the water meadows, with a side main and sluice. The timbers were relatively well-preserved, but the structure had been robbed out in the 20th century.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report describes the methodology and results of two archaeological evaluations undertaken by Tees Archaeology Research and Fieldwork Section at Upleatham, Redcar and Cleveland, and Goldsborough, North Yorkshire. The fieldwork was undertaken in August and September 2008 as part of an English Heritage funded partnership project between Tees Archaeology and the North York Moors National Park Authority researching the Mesolithic in north east Yorkshire.  Both sites are lowland locations in prominent positions, and have been previously identified as sites of potential settlement due to the presence of lithic scatters. They were evaluated using a programme of shovel pitting followed by targeted test pitting. This replaced a fieldwalking programme which could not be carried out due to poor weather delaying the harvesting of crops at both site.  At Upleatham, the flint assemblage demonstrates occupation from at least the late Mesolithic (and possibly early Mesolithic) through to later prehistory. In addition several features were identified: a large ditch, probably an enclosure ditch, a pit and a hearth. Pottery finds indicate that these are all likely to date to the Late Bronze Age or Pre-Roman Iron Age.  At Goldsborough, the shovel pitting produced a very mixed flint assemblage, but two ditches, probably enclosure ditches, were identified. Flint finds indicate that one of these dates to the Mesolithic or early Neolithic.</value>

Limited quantities of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork were also recovered from later deposits. The first evidence of in situ activity is of Middle Neolithic pits containing small assemblages of pottery and flintwork.     At some stage during the Late Neolithic to Late Bronze Age ditches forming part of a field system and/or droveway were installed in the western part of the site. These were superseded by a series of Middle Iron Age droveways and a small number of pits containing pottery.

It was mainly filled with fine-grained sediments, some of which were organic and dated by radiocarbon assay. The earliest deposits were dated to 19480-19039 cal BP. Other sediments were similarly dated to the Neolithic, Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age and Late Saxon. Most evidence for human activity was in the north-west half of the site. The earliest artefacts comprised 61 residual struck flints dated from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age and part of a Late Bronze Age gold bracelet . The excavations provided a transect across a Roman landscape. Two phases of the London-Silchester Roman road were revealed next to the modern London Road. The earlier road was flanked by a ditch and later by a fence. Evidence for Roman occupation on the SE side of the road, clearly represented part a linear settlement that, as previous excavations have shown, extended alongside the road into what is now the centre of Brentford. The evidence included the remains of two substantial timber buildings that had burnt down bread ovens, hearths, pits and gravel surfaces. Successive Roman field systems defined by ditches lay between the settlement and the channel. The ditches also defined a track running down from the settlement to the channel. One ditch contained a human skeleton, and a crouched burial lay in a small grave next to another ditch. Roman artefacts included pottery, fragments building material, two shale armlets, a sandstone palette, fragments of lava quernstone, pieces of glass vessels, iron objects (a stylus, a hipposandal, cleavers, the bowl of a ladle), a lead weight and three bone pins. Copper alloy objects included a large number of coins, several cosmetic or medical implements, fragments of brooches, a bracelet, a hair pin and a fine circular seal box lid.

The condition was advised by the Historic Environment Team at Lincolnshire County Council following completion of an evaluation of the site (Rowe 2013).   The site is situated in an area of significant archaeological potential. Prehistoric activity in the area can be attested by the proximity to the prehistoric trackway running from Caistor High Street. Flint scatters are also known from the area including Mesolithic-Neolthic flints and Barrows were formerly known south of Donington on Bain, approximately 1km southeast of the proposed development.  Previous excavations south of the development site, uncovered two buildings of 10th century date. Later 12th - 14th century features were also present suggesting this area lay on the periphery of the medieval settlement (Rowe 2014). There are known earthworks near and within the site.  Of more significance was the recovery of two almost complete vessels from this site during evaluation trenching, one of which was associated with cremated human bone. Dating these vessels has been problematic and although an Anglo-Saxon date is suspected, they could represent part of a Bronze Age cremation cemetery.

<value columnNumber="1">A geo-archaeological borehole survey consisting of seven Terrier Rig boreholes was carried out to determine the horizons of archaeological interest within the area of proposed building construction.     An evaluation by MoLAS had revealed Late Bronze Age/early Iron Age pottery and shown that a band of black clay, known as the 'BARAS' layer which has been dated to 3700-2200 BC (Neolithic period) was present.  Evidence from the borehole survey demonstrated that the occupation areas extended into the building footprint while the BARAS layer extended across the entire area examined.     Analysis of the borehole cores revealed the changes which had taken place in the local area.  Prior to the development of the salt-marsh where prehistoric archaeology was found, a more active coastal environment is likely to have existed.  Evidence for inter-tidal sand-flats and mud-flats was found, which may relate to the encroachment of the coastline into the Avon levels during the later Mesolithic or early Neolithic period. The emergence of the area from an inter-tidal to a salt-marsh environment is represented by weathered clay silts.  The BARAS horizon is preserved within the salt-marsh deposits and may represent the result of post-depositional processes, resulting from the draining and reclamation of the salt-marshes..  The Late Bronze Age/Iron Age occupation horizon appears to lie at roughly the interface of the salt-marsh and overlying wet meadowland which developed at the margins of the retreating salt marsh.  Weathered alluvial clays representing this more terrestrial environment record the reclamation which has taken place on the Levels since the Roman period.  </value>

Extension of some of the trenches and the mechanical stripping of two Mitigation Areas allowed the examination of a range of archaeological deposits in advance of development.    A limited assemblage of residual struck flints dating from the Mesolithic to the Early Bronze Age were recovered from the overburden and from a limited number of archaeological features. Only a single feature was datable to the Late Iron Age/Romano-British period.     The majority of datable features identified at the current site could be dated to the medieval period, apparently forming a periodically realigned field system in use from the Saxo-Norman period through to the late 13th century. Only limited evidence of post-medieval activity was uncovered during the current project, often in the form of truncation of earlier archaeological features apparently from clearance of trees and bushes.    It is envisaged that the results of the archaeological work from the current site and other local excavations will be assimilated to provide a detailed chronological narrative of the sequence of human activity in the Dittons Road/Shepham Lane area of Polegate.

<value columnNumber="1">In August 2012 Archaeological Solutions Limited (AS) carried out an archaeological trial trench evaluation on land at 122A High Street, Clophill, Bedfordshire (NGR TL 0926 3815).  The evaluation was undertaken to provide further information in support of a planning application for the construction of eight new dwellings (CBC Planning Ref CB/12/02204/FULL).     The site is located in the eastern part of the historic core of the village of Clophill, which is recorded on the Central Bedfordshire Historic Environment Record (HER 16998).  It had the potential to reveal evidence of the medieval and post-medieval development of the village.  In the event the evaluation did not reveal medieval features or finds, and represents negative evidence for this period.  Post-medieval and modern features associated with the dwellings on the High Street were found.    Quite unexpected was the occurrence of struck flint at the interface of the subsoil (L1001) and natural (L1002).  Flint was found in six (Trs. 3 - 8) of the eight trenches.  The struck flint represents a homogenous group and dates to the earlier Mesolithic period.  It is suggested that spread of stuck flint represents a localised area of earlier Mesolithic activity.  Other Mesolithic finds in the local area surrounding Clophill include, c.1.8km to the east, a possible Mesolithic working floor (CBHER 2595) which produced a similar assemblage.      The heritage assets to be affected at this site are therefore the post-medieval remains and Mesolithic flint scatter recorded during the evaluation.  The principal impact of the development on these assets will be the groundworks for the proposed houses, garages and the introduction of services etc.     </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Evidence of prehistoric activity in the area of the site was provided by an extensive flint assemblage, one of the largest to be found in the City to date, which included later Mesolithic/Early Neolithic and Bronze Age flint. A well-preserved Roman sequence of 1st- early 2nd century date was excavated, with the earliest features being 2 N-S 'V-cut' ditches, with the larger E ditch containing transitional late-Iron Age / early Roman pottery. These ditches are interpreted as having formed the W side of the defences around a military zone established soon after the Roman conquest in AD 43. There was intensive pre-Flavian activity on the site - in the form of quarries, ditches, and levelling dumps in preparation for building. After the Boudican revolt of AD60/61 a N-S road was laid out over the ditches, with the road its ditches and portions of the buildings along its edges being defined. The road would have joined with the pre-Boudican E-W road projected as crossing the S end of the site. A well-preserved range of Flavian clay and timber buildings were excavated close to the Walbrook frontage, with a variety of partially waterlogged structures: box-lined sumps, drains and structural timbers also being defined. A notable find was a small ceramic ungent jar containing a number of small items, purposely sealed in one of the walls as a foundation deposit. All of the buildings were destroyed in the Hadrianic fire of AD120-130. Later Roman levels had been truncated, but there was evidence of the N/E corner of a rubble-founded building, scattered pits, and Dark Earth capping the Roman sequence. Medieval and post-medieval remains were predominantly limited to cut features such as pits which included stone and brick-lined wells and cesspits - some containing large finds assemblages. Structural remains included the fragmentary walls and footings of a number of prestigious buildings known to have occupied the site from the medieval period onwards. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report describes the methodology and results of two archaeological evaluations undertaken by Tees Archaeology Research and Fieldwork Section at Upleatham, Redcar and Cleveland, and Goldsborough, North Yorkshire. The fieldwork was undertaken in August and September 2008 as part of an English Heritage funded partnership project between Tees Archaeology and the North York Moors National Park Authority researching the Mesolithic in north east Yorkshire.  Both sites are lowland locations in prominent positions, and have been previously identified as sites of potential settlement due to the presence of lithic scatters. They were evaluated using a programme of shovel pitting followed by targeted test pitting. This replaced a fieldwalking programme which could not be carried out due to poor weather delaying the harvesting of crops at both site.  At Upleatham, the flint assemblage demonstrates occupation from at least the late Mesolithic (and possibly early Mesolithic) through to later prehistory. In addition several features were identified: a large ditch, probably an enclosure ditch, a pit and a hearth. Pottery finds indicate that these are all likely to date to the Late Bronze Age or Pre-Roman Iron Age.  At Goldsborough, the shovel pitting produced a very mixed flint assemblage, but two ditches, probably enclosure ditches, were identified. Flint finds indicate that one of these dates to the Mesolithic or early Neolithic.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology between September and October 2010 on Land Around Pinn Court Farm, Pinhoe, Devon. A total of seventy four trenches was excavated.  The evaluation identified a number of archaeological features within the proposed development area, the majority of which were concentrated in the south of Field B and in the north and west of Field I.  The earliest artefacts encountered consisted of flint blades/bladelets of probable Mesolithic date recovered from the topsoil and/or subsoil within trenches 24, 73 and 74.   Evidence of Bronze Age activity was identified in trench 20, where a ditch containing Middle Bronze Age pottery, would appear to confirm the presence of a large enclosure identified by an earlier geophysical survey. Probable Late Iron Age features, suggesting potential settlement activity, were identified in trench 34. Late Iron Age ditches, possibly relating to agricultural activity and/or land division were identified in trenches 30 and 33. A further enclosure identified in trenches 70, 73 and 75 remained undated.  A possible enclosed roundhouse was identified in trench 22. Although no closely dateable material was recovered from this feature a prehistoric date is postulated for its construction.   Evidence for medieval activity comprised pits containing 12th to 14th-century pottery in trenches 32 and 44. Evidence for post-medieval quarrying/sand extraction was identified in trench 70. Further post-medieval or modern features, relating to agricultural activity and land division, were identified in Fields B and I.  </value>

Using geochemical analysis of sediments collected from the site the project has mapped the soil chemistry of the site and assessed its implications for the preservation of organic material. It has also undertaken physical analysis on organic artefacts collected from the different excavations at Star Carr to document the deteriorating levels of preservation at the site. The results have shown that the levels of preservation at the site have deteriorated significantly and that any remaining organic material, both archaeological and environmental, is under serious threat. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In September 2004 an archaeological evaluation was undertaken at Castle Wharf, Bridge Street, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, on behalf of Fourth Avenue Estates Ltd. The work was required in advance of proposed residential redevelopment, and followed a desk-based study of the site.  Beneath a 2m horizon of made-up ground was a layer of alluvium, sealing what is believed to be an old river channel. Within this 'palaeo-channel' was a thick deposit of peat created between the later part of the early Mesolithic (9700 to 9550 Cal BP) and the Neolithic (4760 to 4640 Cal BP). This represents a time span between the late Boreal period, when pine woodland was being replaced by deciduous trees, and the Atlantic period, when there was predominance of lime woodland. This 4000-year period covers the time when mankind first had an impact on the landscape, and when humans first settled in, or adjacent to, the Bulbourne valley.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">This document reports on an archaeological evaluation by fieldwalkilng undertaken by The Archaeological Practice Ltd at the request of BHP Develop for a proposed extension to Eppleton Quarry, Sunderland.    Archaeological evaluation by fieldwalking in early October 2010 following a programme of geophysical survey carried out in August 2010, the cumulative purpose of which was to investigate the archaeological potential of the site in accordance with a Brief supplied by the Tyne and Wear Archaeological Officer.    The broad conclusion drawn from the fieldwalking exercise is that the only significant finds made on the site are worked stone artifacts interpreted as of Mesolithic origin which are clustered on high ground in the north part of the site where geophysical survey had previously identified features of likely later prehistoric origin. The only find directly supporting later prehistoric occupation on the site, however, is a single sherd of likely prehistoric pottery.    In interpreting these results it is considered unlikely that the worked stone tools are associated with the physical remains of enclosures, which are likely to be later in origin, and appears likely, therefore, that the site has seen episodic use in the past.    The survival of archaeological remains within the site is such that any proposals for the development of the site should elicit an additional phase of archaeological evaluation, the scope and scale of which will be determined by the Tyne  and  Wear Archaeological Officer.    It is recommended that a series archaeological evaluation trenches should be excavated within the site, particularly but not exclusively targeting the areas where geophysical prospection has identified the sub-surface remains of features including enclosures, and where fieldwalking has recovered highest concentrations of worked stone artifacts.  </value>

Alongside excavation work conducted on the nearby new school playing field, the information acquired overall indicates a nationally important site, showing  evidence of late prehistoric activity in an area where little had been previously identified.

<value columnNumber="1">This report is intended to inform the reader of the results of the excavation at 2 Little Smith Street: The excavations at 2 Little Smith Street were undertaken in accordance with the method statement produced by the Museum of London Archaeology (see Aitken 2009). Late Pleistocene sands potentially associated with the southern lower lying edge of Thorney Island have been identified; the surface of the sands is approximately at 0 m OD. The sediments were OSL dated to 15,000 yrs ago (&amp;#177;1000 years), placing them in the Late Pleistocene much earlier than the Early Holocene date previously given them (Sidell et al 2000). Therefore, there exist potential for human occupation on this dry land surface from the Late Pleistocene to Early Mesolithic and onwards, which should be considered in any future work on local sites. Thorney Island is a significant feature in London's archaeological record for our understanding of how the River Thames and its confluences influence past events, such the foundation of Westminster Abbey.  The excavations were also located to the south of the precinct of Westminster Abbey. Despite the site's proximity to such a significant historic site, cartographic evidence indicates the site was not built upon until the early-mid 17th century. Evidence of these early buildings were found in the form of walls, a pit, possibly two inglenook fireplaces and a brick-lined cess pit. Within the cess pit, a dump of clearance debris was excavated. Significant within this debris were pottery and glass assemblages associated with the Low Countries, suggesting the occupant of the associated property might have been a wealth Flemish merchant or similar professional.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A moderate assemblage of worked flints, mostly undiagnostic and with a broad date range, demonstrates activity in the vicinity of the site during the Mesolithic to Early Bronze Age periods. The prehistoric flints mostly occurred as residual finds in later deposits. A small amount of probable earlier Iron Age pottery, also residual, provides further evidence for prehistoric activity in the area.    The evaluation revealed significant evidence for occupation in the Roman period.    Roman pottery, ranging in date from the 1st- to 4th century AD, was recovered from fills of a ring ditch associated with a suspected Bronze Age barrow FRK 008. This suggests either that the monument was constructed in the Roman period or that a prehistoric barrow was re-used at that time.    Roman features, notably pits and ditches and some possible postholes, were found throughout the site but were concentrated in central and eastern areas, suggesting a settlement in the vicinity of the ring ditch/barrow. Fragments of roof tile from several of these features suggest that there was one or more substantial buildings nearby, although no in situ building remains were found.    A north-south ditch in the western part of the site produced 3rd-century Roman pottery and a coin of AD 275-285. This was probably part of an extensive, rectilinear ditch suggested by the geophysical survey, forming a large enclosure associated with the Roman settlement.  </value>

Previous archaeological works in the area have uncovered a range of prehistoric remains, but of greater significance have been the extensive Roman and Anglo-Saxon occupation deposits. On site the levels were generally well preserved, despite frequent disturbance from rabbit burrowing.    Underlying layers of modern material, as well as a windblown sand deposit (that has been recorded elsewhere on the base) was a layer of occupation soil that appeared to have formed throughout the Roman and Early Anglo-Saxon periods and possibly into the Middle Saxon period. This overlaid Early Anglo-Saxon ditches and a possible beam slot. Underlying this were three phases of Roman ditches, and scattered small pits, as well as an earlier phase or Roman pits and a posthole. The earliest archaeological context was a later prehistoric layer.     Finds from the site included Mesolithic/earlier Neolithic and later prehistoric flint work, Iron Age, Roman, Early Anglo-Saxon an Middle Saxon pottery, Roman ceramic building material, quern stone fragments, coins and an Iron nail, as well as fired clay, slag and a pintle (the latter being of possible post-medieval date).

<value columnNumber="1">In July 2013 the Cambridge Archaeological Unit carried out a programme of archaeological monitoring and recording during excavations for the second phase of the Flood Compensation Scheme at the Babraham Research Campus. This involved a topsoil and partial subsoil strip of two areas which lie close to the river frontage, thus 200m to the north-west of the archaeologically excavated R and D Land, and beyond the area of the main Roman settlement. No archaeology was revealed in Area A (0.28 ha), which in places was stripped down to the underlying chalk, but in Area B (0.39 ha) at the south end, a number of amorphous burnt flint spreads and pits of probable Neolithic - Early Bronze Age date were found during the digging of a balance pond and drain. These features were cut by a series of three narrow NW-SE to SSE-NNW trending ditches of probable Roman date. To the north-east of this excavation a field walk and metal detecting survey of the stripped topsoil revealed an interesting but mixed-up assemblage of material which included Mesolithic - Early Bronze Age flint, minor amounts of Roman pottery, lead scrap and a coin, plus a slightly better assemblage of Medieval metalwork including a well-preserved Henry III silver penny, a number of 12th-14th century copper-alloy buckles and straps, and a few Postmedieval - modern finds.

The evaluation was informed by previous excavations at Stratford's Yard to the south of the site, where in-situ Mesolithic and Neolithic deposits had been recorded in the 1960s, with some additional work taking place in the 1980s.  A desk-based assessment undertaken in 2002 confirmed the historical and archaeological significance of the site. Three evaluation trenches were excavated by Birmingham Archaeology in 2003, the first of which produced Bronze Age ceramics, animal bone and flintwork from two pits. An area excavation of the site followed on from this initial evaluative stage, recording several pits clustering around a ring ditch situated at the northern limit of the excavation area. An in-situ Bronze Age vessel was recorded and a flintwork assemblage broadly datable to the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Four radiocarbon dates were obtained from the site dating to between the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. In addition, some residual Mesolithic material was recovered, although no associated buried soil horizons, such as those recorded at Stratford's Yard, were encountered. The lower western area of the site had been truncated by a number of large post-medieval features, whilst the higher ground to the east showed evidence of having been truncated by terracing activity below the original level of natural chalk</value>

Worked flint dating to the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods was observed in ploughed fields. No features relating to the prehistoric period were encountered during excavation.     Two undated drainage features, 5m apart were revealed during open cut excavation carried out along the eastern side of 'Hammer Meadow',  a field containing channels and earthworks relating to post-medieval water management.     Both features were wide flat bottomed ditches with sloping sides. One, fully silted-up, contained the remains of several logs in the base, with a later narrower re-cut containing a chalk fill and some evidence of possible ditch clearance. The second ditch, probably the later feature, contained a substantial stone culvert. The location suggests it channelled water into one of the main water channels, still evident today.  Previous investigation suggests local water meadows and the hammer pond at Abinger Mill were allowed controlled seasonal releases of water from the Tillingbourne stream from the 17th to the 19th century.    Evidence of a small water channel, which may represent an original tributary of the Tillingbourne stream was recorded in the car park of 'Grant House' the location of the now demolished mill.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Work on new underground cable and excavation for four transformers was monitored between September 2008 and June 2009, by G Rapson for Museum of London Archaeology at Loseley Park, near Guildford Surrey.    The majority of the cable was laid by mole-plough resulting in minimal excavation. In addition to the excavation work, a local ploughing competition presented an opportunity to field walk several areas adjacent to the cable trenches      Six archaeological features were recorded.   Excavation in Sunnydown, in a natural dip in the topography at the junction between the chalk and clay geology, revealed a buried layer containing Bronze Age pottery, burnt flint and occasional worked flint. The presence of burnt flint visible in the surrounding ploughed fields suggests an extensive area of prehistoric activity, possibly associated with a natural spring.    In the Polstead Lodge area, located on a gravel terrace, four undated field ditches, two of which are probably of modern date, were recorded and ploughed fields provided evidence of prehistoric activity, in the form of occasional burnt and worked flint pieces.    The remains of an undated flint structure was recorded on the western edge of the large ditch, located south of Conduit Farm. The feature may relate to field buildings or an earlier drainage feature.    Occasional Mesolithic flint pieces were observed in the topsoil on West Warren ridge and also in E-W sandy track to the north of West Warren. Three sherds of Roman pottery were also recovered from the track north of East Warren.       </value>

The area is located c 200m S of an area of moss and peat with preserved  timbers dating to the Mesolithic at Moss-side, Cove. At the N end of the present site on the lower ground a thick layer c 500-600mm of boggy peat was formed of well preserved bark, branches and twigs. This resembled the timbers at Moss-side and almost certainly represents the S continuation of the Mesolithic non- anthropogenic woodland.

<value columnNumber="1">In March 2006 Archaeological Solutions (AS) carried out an archaeological desk-based assessment of land at the site of proposed U3 Building, GlaxoSmithKline, Priory Street, Ware, Hertfordshire. The proposed development lies on the periphery of the Roman settlement at Ware, which straddles Ermine Street.  Previous excavations at GSK have investigated the Roman vicus,, which developed along the Roman road of Ermine Street in the years following the Conquest of 43 AD.  The settlement appears to have comprised industrial and domestic activity together with a possible shrine or temple sited on the course of the road and extending for some way into back plots.  The concentration of Roman burials, on the eastern and western sides of the small town delineate the limits of the settlement.  Numerous investigations at GlaxoSmithKline have helped define the Roman settlement, as well as locating more limited evidence for prehistoric activity from the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Iron Age.      Cartographic evidence suggests that the assessment area was relatively undeveloped until the early 20th century.  It remained as two large fields, with only malthouses occupying the south-eastern sector, on the 1st Edition 1878 OS 25. It was only until the construction of Allen  and  Hanbury's factory in 1899 that the site was subject to major redevelopment. A watching brief in 1993 on the site failed to reveale any archaeological remains, although the natural substrate was not reached. There is potential for Roman remains / burials providing the site has not been subjected to significant levels of modern disturbance.</value>

The watching brief took place intermittently from 30th November 2009 to the 10th March 2010. The work revealed a scatter of unstratified worked flint of Mesolithic-Bronze Age date, in the colluvium to the southeast of the existing school but no archaeological features, deposits or further artefacts were encountered. The geoarchaeological aspect consisted of the monitoring and recording of the reduction of the attenuation tank to a depth of 2.4m. Sections were plotted at 6m intervals to identify and sample the natural downwards slope of the solifluction gravels from south to north and particular care was taken to identify any buried occupation layers beneath the colluvium.

The route passed through 2 archaeologically sensitive areas, comprising the later Medieval and post-medieval village of Brightling and the area around the early 19th century Observatory. Fields in this area, in particular Lodge Field, have been the focus of a long-term fieldwalking project, which recorded nearly 1000 pieces of worked flint dating from the early Mesolithic period through to the Bronze Age. Excavation carried out in Lodge field in August 2008 revealed an intact Mesolithic land surface, buried beneath hill wash deposits.    The majority of the underground cable was laid using a mole-plough through pasture and alongside the existing carriageway, but some open cut  excavations enabled useful archaeological information to be added to the existing record.     Very little evidence of past activity was observed on site. Undated archaeological deposits relating to iron production were recorded in section in two areas to the east of Great Worge, while remains of a brick drain were recorded close to the Observatory. A small section of 19th century trackway was seen in excavations at Sheepshaw. Natural ground consisted of a variety of sandy clays and sandstone bedding with some build up of colluvium at the base of slopes at Great Worge, Brightling Down Farm, and Longreach Farm  </value>

The position and orientation of the trenches was determined by the proposed development and the location of trees, services and garden features. The evaluation revealed evidence for Late Mesolithic/earlier Neolithic activity, in the form of two tree throws and worked flint, potential medieval activity in the form of a pit, and two linears and a posthole of uncertain date.  A wall related to mid 19th century outbuildings was also recorded.

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeological investigations revealed moderately well preserved archaeological features and deposits, which included evidence for late Mesolithic occupation activity, in the form of a relatively substantial flint scatter, along with a limited assemblage of late Neolithic/early Bronze Age flints and a small amount of Iron Age pottery. A probable Prehistoric ring-ditch was also present; however, it remained unclear if it represented a truncated barrow ditch or a roundhouse drip-gully.  Roman settlement evidence, represented by pits, postholes, ditches and a probable corn drier, was datable to the earlier-mid Roman period. A large number of the pits were probably limestone quarries, with the corn drier, ditches and dispersed postholes and pits most likely representing activity related to an agricultural regime. The recovered Roman pottery, CBM, animal bone and small finds assemblages were consistent with a rural settlement.  There was limited evidence that at least some of the Roman features were in-filled in the Saxon or early-Medieval period.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A coastal erosion walk-over survey was conducted around the north-west peninsulas of Wester Ross, Highlands. The survey aimed to establish the potential of eroding coastlines to yield early prehistoric sites in the region, which are lacking compared to many other areas of Scotland due to preservation and research bias, and to contribute to active monitoring of archaeological sites at risk of erosion.  Two sites with evidence of prehistoric occupation were identified. The first is a previously unrecorded burnt mound of probable Bronze Age date, with underlying early Neolithic evidence. The mound comprises characteristic charcoal-rich deposits and heat-affected stones, with a quartz-dominated lithic industry and minute fragments of pottery. The second site is a suspected Mesolithic shell midden within a rock shelter that was indicated by a previous coastal erosion survey. Surface collection of eroding materials comprised a range of marine mollusc, animal bone and a quantity of worked quartz. Whilst undiagnostic, this supports the suggested date.  A total of 25 sites from the HER were visited, few of which are actively eroding. Six previously unrecorded sites of post-medieval to modern date were also recorded, along with a small number of stray finds.</value>

The work was carried out during April 2008 and recorded roads, tracks and paths as well as multiple layers of made ground and buried soil horizons that relate to the remodelling of the landscape in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by John Nash and John Nesfield .  Older occupation at the site was represented by finds; an architectural stone was recovered that may relate to an earlier phase of the house and a small flint, possibly a fragment from a Mesolithic microlith that  was recovered on-top of undisturbed natural gravel.    No significant archaeological structures or features were recorded and the limited nature of the excavations meant that damage to archaeological deposits was minimal  </value>

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation was carried out on land off of Bures Road, Great Cornard in advance of the relocation of Sudbury Rugby club grounds in May 2007.  The excavation has identified evidence of funerary activity in the Bronze Age period, with a possible earlier phase of occupation in the Mesolithic/Early Neolithic. Features identified consisted of a sparse scatter of pits lying adjacent to a small ring ditch with central pit. A small finds assemblage, predominantly consisting of struck flint, indicated that activity on the site was not domestic in nature.    Although no human burial was identified the ring ditch and pit are clearly related to the wider landscape of Bronze Age funerary activity that is known in the vicinity, with several ring ditches, originally identified by aerial photograpy, lying immediately to the north-west.   Recent excavations by SCCAS in 2009 of two of these large ring ditches, on the former rugby pitch, also identified another example of a small ring ditch.    Following the prehistoric period there is no evidence of any activity on the site until the post-medieval period where three linear ditches probably represent former field boundaries.    A recommendation has been made for the site results to be considered in any future archaeological publication of these latter excavations.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In September 2005 Archaeological Solutions Ltd conducted an archaeological desk-based assessment of land at Methley Quarry, Methley, West Yorkshire (NGR SE 406 263). The assessment site comprises a parcel of agricultural land currently used for arable cultivation. Although no archaeological or historical sites are known within the assessment site, the surrounding area contains evidence of a quite extensive Iron Age and Romano-British landscape, including field systems and settlement. There is also evidence for human occupation of the Methley area in the Mesolithic, Neolithic and even into the Bronze Age. Medieval pottery and other evidence is recorded in the area surrounding the site. Due to the extensive evidence for past occupation in the Methley area, much coming from previous phases of archaeological work on land owned by Methley Quarry, the potential for archaeological remains to exist within the assessment site is significant. Any archaeology that does exist within the assessment area may be associated with the extensive Iron Age and Romano-British landscape, or may prove to be associated with the site of the medieval farmstead south of Dunford House.</value>

Three features, two parallel ditches and a pit were identified cut into the top of the alluvium. These are most likely of contemporary date and ditch [4/003] contained a find of Late Iron Age/early Roman pottery. The ditches are likely to be field boundary ditches or a droveway indicative of an agricultural land-use.     Other periods are solely represented by finds of a residual Mesolithic/Neolithic flintwork piece and a single sherd of medieval pottery.    The geoarchaeological investigations proved that the site can be considered to exist on the margins of the Willingdon Levels coastal marsh system, the site therefore has always been on the western flank of the inlet system.     The geoarchaeological investigations have characterised the site as representing an area of relatively high- free draining land on the margins of the coastal marshes of the Willingdon levels which were subjected to alluvial over-bank deposits at a relatively late stage relative to the rest of the marshes. They may therefore have represented an area of relatively dry land close to important salt marsh and estuarine resources in Late Prehistory.  </value>

There was then a gap in observable activity, caused by rising water levels and the site becoming inundated. Archaeological deposits dating from the early post-medieval period up to the 20th century were recorded, the area having been reclaimed during the late medieval/early post-medieval period. The earliest features on the site are dated to the Neolithic period. Towards the southern half of the site were numerous ard marks of later Neolithic to Bronze Age date. Contemporary with these were numerous stakeholes. Two large, possible cooking pits were also observed. These features were sealed by a site-wide layer of sand, which was subsequently disturbed by later activity. A number of features were cut into the surface of the sand and represented one or more later prehistoric phases of activity. A Roman ditch was also cut along the line of a Neolithic channel and was itself recut. Following limited Roman activity, the site became inundated by rising Thames waters and thick alluvium was deposited. The site was re-occupied in the post-medieval period, following reclamation. The earliest features were associated with this. From the 18th century the site became dominated by elements of the leather industry. A number of tanning pits and associated structures were recorded across the site. In addition to the abundant evidence of industrial activity a number of other features suggested the presence of both timber framed and masonry buildings. These related to structures contemporary with both the leather industry and vinegar manufacture, which was carried out on the site from 1814 until the later 20th century.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of a geoarchaeological evaluation carried out by the Museum of London Archaeology (MoLA) at Selbourne House, 54-60 Victoria Street, London SW1, City of Westminster.     The proposed development involves the demolition of the present 1960s building and the construction of a new 11-storey office and retail building at the site. The Ordnance Survey National Grid Reference for the site is 529446 179284.    Five auger holes were sunk using a Cobra power auger in the upper basement area. The auger hole results indicate that any alluvium or areas of earlier human activity have probably been removed by the 1960's development of Selbourne House. The sediments recorded show made ground lying directly on top of Late Pleistocene deposits of sands and clays. No alluvium was present. The evaluation has provided a refinement of the Pleistocene deposits and has aided the reconstruction of pre-Holocene surface / Mesolithic landscape locally.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In April 2008, North Pennines Archaeology Ltd were commissioned by Wardell Armstrong LLP to undertake a sixty-six trench evaluation on land off Muston Road, Filey, North Yorkshire (NGR TA 111 800).  The fieldwork took place between 2nd-25th April, following an application for a proposed new residential development by Persimmon Homes, on land to the east of Muston Road. Previous work on site in the form of geophysical survey had been performed by North Pennines Archaeology Limited and the evaluation targeted anomalies detected in that survey, as well as 'sterile' areas where the geophysics failed to pick anything up.  The objective of the evaluation was to determine the presence or absence, nature and extent of any archaeological anomalies within the proposed development area.  The prehistoric pottery found in sealed contexts within the evaluation trenches dated exclusively to the late prehistoric, specifically the pre-Roman Iron Age.  Environmental analysis also revealed the presence of certain plant fibres indicating the potential of the site for rope making or similar activities during this period.  The presence of the lithics as well as the late prehistoric archaeological features such as the potential roundhouse in Trench 54 indicate the presence of continued human activity on the site from the Mesolithic through to the later prehistoric, the pre-Roman Iron Age.  Parts of the site are of archaeological importance and any removal of or disturbance to the features and or deposits should be mitigated through excavation or preservation in situ.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Excavations targeted the remains of a significant  rectangular double-ditched enclosure identified through geophysical survey in  2011. Open-area excavation of the site between October 2018 and February 2019  and a programme of post-excavation analysis demonstrated that the enclosure  was created and utilised in the earlier Middle Bronze Age, with activity curtailing at  the site after approximately two centuries.  Evidence shows that the enclosure was situated in an open landscape of rough  grasses, with little arable cultivation occurring in the vicinity of the site. A pastoral  impetus most likely lies behind the creation of the enclosure; however, its  monumental and elaborate nature suggests that it probably also had an important  symbolic function within society. A number of structures were identified within the  enclosure, along with 'burnt mound' activity possibly associated with large-scale  cooking, industry or ritual.  The enclosure remained open into the 1st millennium BC, with sporadic use of the  site appearing to have occurred throughout the Late Bronze Age. A more  significant re-establishment of activity within the enclosure took place during the  earlier Iron Age. Activity during this period included a slight modification to the  south-west of the enclosure, but beyond this, the character of this phase of  occupation was not able to be defined from the evidence available.  Pre-enclosure activity at the site consisted of a transient Mesolithic presence, as  well as small-scale Early Neolithic occupation, with a 'developed' pit cluster being  identified. Evidence for anthropogenic activity at the site after the earlier Iron Age  occupation was minor, with it being unlikely that the site underwent significant  agrarian exploitation until the 18th/early 19th century.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between June 2005 and February 2008, Archaeological Solutions carried out two stages of  archaeological investigation on land adjoining 80 Wisbech Road, Littleport, Cambridgeshire (NGR TL 5608 8732), in advance of residential development. The site encompassed part of the former Fen edge on the north side of Littleport 'island'.  The investigations revealed three phases of activity, focused on the higher, drier southern part of the site. Scattered struck flint indicated sporadic activity during the early Neolithic (Phase 1), when this area was probably dry. In the late Bronze Age/ early Iron Age (Phase 2), numerous shallow pits, some containing pottery and occasional daub fragments, suggest the site lay within paddocks on the periphery of a settlement further to the south. Peat growth in the north of the site was well-developed by this time, having begun around the middle Bronze Age. Remains of two ditches, the larger of which ran down into the fen, suggest that similar agricultural land use continued into the late Iron Age (Phase 3). Part of a ?curated Mesolithic/ Neolithic quartzite pebble hammer was found in the upper fill of the larger ditch, close to its terminus. This might represent a deliberately-placed 'votive'  deposit. Its deposition may have been associated with the rising water table, which was causing flooding on the site around this time and probably led to its abandonment soon after. Column samples contained well-preserved pollen evidence for later prehistoric environmental change and agriculture in this part of Littleport.</value>

A fieldwalking and metal detector survey located a low density of pre-modern finds which are as likely to be the result of manuring or casual loss as from activity within the development area. 85 evaluation trenches revealed scattered features of prehistoric, Roman and post-medieval date over much of the site in the form of  pits and boundary ditches, whilst an area of concentrated features was recorded in the south west corner of the site which may relate to Roman activity. Two deep, infilled valleys were present within the evaluation area, both following the natural slope down towards the south west. Generally, the valley fills comprised sterile, colluvial deposits, the result of progressive movement of sediments down hill. At the base of the slope in the south west corner of the site, accumulated peat deposits appear to fill a shallow channel which environmental evidence suggests began to fill during the Mesolithic period.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">This document presents the results of a geoarchaeological environmental assessment work carried out on four borehole cores undertaken at Silwood Estate, Phase 4c. The work was commissioned from MOLA by the client, L and Q Group.    Across the site 5 major depositional units (facies) were identified. The basal units consisted of coarse grained sand and gravel units of the Shepperton Gravel (facies 1).   Lake bank or strand line deposits (facies 2) consisting of sandy silt to organic sandy clays. These deposits contained no diatoms but preserved good pollen assemblages relating to a nearby dryland Birch dominated woodland. These lake deposits mark the northern limit of the Bermondsey Lake. The deposits provide a shorter sequence than at similar sites (eg Bramcote Green (Thomas et al 1996) and Varcoe Road (Halsey 2009) but benefits from organic lake fills of a Late Mesolithic date (BETA 287057).    The overlying peats (facies 3b) sealing the lake bank deposits can be firmly linked to the Bronze Age peat observed at Bramcote Green (Thomas et al 1996). These deposits have shown a potential to preserve pollen and plant macro fossils. Given the apparent location of the site on the margins of the wetland and lake, and with a high dry island of Shepperton gravel to the north of the site, the present deposits sequence could refine our understanding of the development of the lake and Thames floodplain in an diverse and varied environment.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In November 2010 Foundations Archaeology undertook a programme of  archaeological evaluation on land at Parsonage Farm, Henfield, West Sussex. The  project was commissioned by Charles Church South Coast.  A planning application (Planning Ref: DC/09/1222) has been submitted to West  Sussex County Council to develop an area of land at Parsonage Farm for residential  usage. A desk-based assessment of the site was undertaken by Foundations  Archaeology in July 2009. The assessment highlighted that the site has some  archaeological potential for finds and features of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic  periods. It also noted that the site area appears to have low potential for finds or  features of the later Prehistoric, Roman or Saxon periods, which would be consistent  with the results of evaluation trenching associated with earlier phases of development.  Therefore, in accordance with the general principles of PPS5 (Planning Policy  Statement 5), a condition requiring a programme of archaeological evaluation works  was attached to the planning application by West Sussex County Council.  A total of twenty five 50m by 2m trenches and fifty hand dug test-pits approximately  2m by 2m, excavated within the confines of the trenches, were excavated across the  study area.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological watching brief was undertaken by Oakford Archaeology between July and August 2014 during work at Four Burrow Farm, Kenwyn, Cornwall.     The site lies in an area of archaeological potential immediately to the southwest of the Four Burrows Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM 29602). Further prehistoric activity, in the form of flint tools of the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods have also been identified, while undated earthworks and cropmarks have been identified to the east. Preliminary archaeological work included a desk-based assessment and a geophysical survey, carried out by Substrata in July and August 2012. This identified a number of linear and other anomaly patterns including possible barrows.   A watching brief was maintained during works associated with the construction of a solar farm and associated cabling works. A number of trenches, totalling 3800m and 0.6-1.2m deep, were monitored, as well as three pads for electrical cabinets and the foundations of the DNO building. These were on average 12m long, 8m wide and 0.3-1.2m deep, and revealed a simple deposit sequence of topsoil above natural subsoil extending across the entire site.  No deposits, features or dating evidence pre-dating the modern period were found which would indicate significant archaeological activity within the monitored areas. The lack of pottery and lithics from the site, despite examination of spoil heaps, further indicates that the potential for reduced barrow mounds and satellite burials is extremely low. Evidence from the works would suggest that settlement activity associated with the barrows is likely to be located elsewhere in the landscape, with the site remaining marginal heathland until being enclosed in the mid-19th century. None of the anomalies indicated by the geophysical survey were found; it is probable that these relate either to geological or 20th-century agricultural activity. </value>

When combined with other previous records from the site, the sub-surface stratigraphy revealed a sloping gravel surface from south to north, representing the base of the Bankside palaeochannel. The palaeochannel was infilled with alluvium and a thick sequence of peat. An assessment of the samples revealed the peat dated from the Early Mesolithic to Late Neolithic, representing a new record from this area of London. Analysis of the microfossil and macrofossil remains indicated a transition from open cold conditions with sedges, grasses, and pine and birch woodland, to alder dominated carr woodland on the wetland, and mixed deciduous woodland on the dryland.

<value columnNumber="1">A small assemblage of residual Mesolithic and Early Neolithic struck flint suggests at least some activity of this date in the vicinity of the site but the earliest stratified activity appears to be of Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age date and comprised a large deep pit, containing a small assemblage of 'Beaker' pottery. There is an apparent hiatus in activity during much of the Middle Bronze age and it is not until towards the end of this period that activity recommences, with the deposition of a near-complete pottery vessel in the northwest corner of the site.     The Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age periods are typified by an expansion in agricultural activity on the site, marked by the appearance of an east-west aligned droveway. A probable hearth or fire pit in the northwest corner of the site can also be dated to this period and, together with pits more broadly dated to the later prehistoric period, may indicate activity peripheral to settlement during the period.     No Middle Iron Age activity could be identified on the site and activity of Late Iron Age date is restricted to two large, amorphous features in the northwest corner of the site that represent areas of turbation or mixing of the underlying natural geology, perhaps as a result of trampling by livestock.     Other features dated broadly to the later prehistoric period include an additional droveway and Holloway or lynchet, both aligned along the axis of the dry valley and a group of pits and postholes and north-south aligned ditch in the southeast of the site. These are accompanied by a range of undated features dispersed across the site that include field boundary ditches on a variety of alignments, as well as various pits, postholes and tree throws.    </value>

This comprised a topsoil strip and cut of new drainage pipes, installation of manholes and the excavation of an open ditch, from Artle Beck Bridge in Caton (NGR SD 53426 64442), through undulating pasture fields to the south of Caton, ending to south of St Paul's Drive in Brookhouse (NGR SD 54106 64346). Oxford Archaeology North (OA North) was commissioned to undertake the watching brief, which took place between 15th March and 6th May 2011.  No archaeological evidence was observed during the topsoil strip of the route, but further excavation did reveal three features of archaeological significance, none of which dated to the Roman period as had been anticipated. The features of significance comprised a palaeochannel (1004 and 1005), a possible buried soil horizon (1006) and a large ditch (1009). These features contained only two finds. The buried soil, 1006, contained a bone knife handle that could not be precisely dated. The large ditch, 1009, contained a Mesolithic retouched flint blade, thought to be residual.   The small number of archaeological features and finds observed during the course of the monitoring of the groundworks would suggest that the landscape has changed very little over time. However, the presence of such a large ditch implies a feature of archaeological significance. Consequently, it is recommended that this feature be further investigated should any future work have an impact upon it.</value>

The fieldwork took place between 2nd-25th April, following an application for a proposed new residential development by Persimmon Homes, on land to the east of Muston Road. Previous work on site in the form of geophysical survey had been performed by North Pennines Archaeology Limited and the evaluation targeted anomalies detected in that survey, as well as 'sterile' areas where the geophysics failed to pick anything up.  The objective of the evaluation was to determine the presence or absence, nature and extent of any archaeological anomalies within the proposed development area.  The prehistoric pottery found in sealed contexts within the evaluation trenches dated exclusively to the late prehistoric, specifically the pre-Roman Iron Age.  Environmental analysis also revealed the presence of certain plant fibres indicating the potential of the site for rope making or similar activities during this period.  The presence of the lithics as well as the late prehistoric archaeological features such as the potential roundhouse in Trench 54 indicate the presence of continued human activity on the site from the Mesolithic through to the later prehistoric, the pre-Roman Iron Age.  Parts of the site are of archaeological importance and any removal of or disturbance to the features and or deposits should be mitigated through excavation or preservation in situ.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of stage three of a three-staged evaluation on the site of Northfleet West Substation, Southfleet Road, Swanscombe, Kent. The third stage involved a programme of trial trenching for post-Palaeolithic archaeology and further test pitting for Palaeolithic archaeology.  The combined results of all three phases of work have contributed to a deposit model and recommendations for the the Palaeolithic potential of the Pleistocene sediments and also the potential for later archaeology, within the more recent (Holocene) deposits.  A Historic Environment Research Framework has been included in this document and will inform development proposals for the site.  The three stages of archaeological evaluation of the site have demonstrated that the majority of it is of no, or little, Palaeolithic archaeological potential. There does not, therefore seem to be any basis for restricting development in the less important areas, categorised as N1 to N6 in the updated assessment of potential. However, a few, smaller areas of the site (categorised as N7 to N8 and N10) are of high Palaeolithic potential. In particular area N10 a number of in situ Palaeolithic flint artefacts were recovered directly beneath the plough soil and are very vulnerable to even the slightest impact. One other area N9 is of medium potential for Palaeolithic archaeology.   The post-palaeolithic archaeology is restricted to one shallow feature in the north west of the site and some flint, pottery and building material remains of a Mesolithic to Roman date in the subsoil and colluvium across the rest of the site. It is likely that these remains relate to more intensive activity in the upland areas of the Ebsfleet valley but suggest a low potential for further archaeology on most of the site.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The assessment has highlighted that the site is of moderate-high archaeological  potential for the recovery of prehistoric finds and of low potential for remains from  the Roman through to the Post-medieval period.  The site appears to have been agricultural land throughout the Medieval and early  Post-medieval periods. It remained undeveloped until circa 1935, when the tennis  courts were constructed, followed by the public house circa 1956. A number of  garages/short lived structures were subsequently constructed within the site, close to  the southern boundary. The foundations for these earlier structures are likely to lie  beneath the present industrial buildings and may only survive in a fragmentary form.  The main archaeological potential of the site is therefore for the presence of  Mesolithic finds. It should be noted, however, that construction of the tennis grounds  and the public house may have caused an impact on any archaeological deposits that  may have been present. Features of Mesolithic date are likely to have been  insubstantial and easily destroyed. However, with the exception of two garage blocks,  the level of disturbance in the southern part of the site, which is of the highest  potential, may have been relatively light. Preservation of Mesolithic archaeological  finds and features in this area may, therefore, be considered possible.</value>

The underlying natural of chalk and brickearth was encountered between the heights of 56.25m OD in the north of the site (trench 7) and 58.81m OD in the south (trench 1). The topography was of gardens, gently sloping from south to north.     The evaluation identified three main phases of activity: early prehistoric, Middle Iron Age and Early Roman. The early prehistoric included the remains of a possible post-built structure of Mesolithic date in the north of the site. Elsewhere, finds of residual flint work were recovered of Mesolithic, Early Neolithic and Bronze Age date.     The Middle Iron Age and Early Roman phases mirrored the activity identified on the Ashcombe House site to the immediate south, with an apparent hiatus in occupation during the Late Iron Age. Middle Iron Age features identified included a grain-storage pit and two pits containing structured deposits of placed human long bones and an inverted horse skull. The identification of a possible Mesolithic structure and Middle Iron Age features is rare in the wider vicinity of the site and in Greater London in general.     The evaluation was able to demonstrate that the area around the former hospital buildings in the centre of the site had been terraced into the gentle south to north slope, including the raising of the ground level by at least 1.5m in the area of the car park to the north.  </value>

The site is close to the historic core of the village of Stanstead St Margarets which encompasses the medieval settlement and church, and also the post-medieval maltings. Available documentary and cartographic evidence indicates that the land at Sanville Gardens was used for agricultural and horticultural timber processing in the historic period. The field evaluation revealed undated features and also ditches of medieval date, located mainly on the higher ground in the south-western part of the site. Residual struck flints of Mesolithic and Neolithic date were also present, and broadly contemporary with similar finds in the Lea Valley. No dated prehistoric features were present. A deposit of timber within the upper surface of the peat in Trench 13 was carefully hand-cleaned and examined, but was found to be of natural origin and unaltered. Four environmental samples were radio-carbon dated broadly to the Neolithic period. The dating of the samples corresponded with their stratigraphic relationship, in that the uppermost sample (100) was the youngest of the four. The peat deposit L1075 therefore had a total date range of 690 years between Cal BP 5990-5300 (3990-3300 BC).</value>

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green.

There has been little detailed archaeological investigation in the area surrounding the site, although struck flints dating from the Mesolithic through to the Bronze Age have been recovered. Although a Roman road runs close to the site and a possibly Saxon lane demarcates the eastern boundary, little activity from these periods has been recorded in the area. Medieval settlement in the area is known from the Domesday Survey. The cartographic evidence suggests the site has no undergone any significant development.    The geological assessment revealed that the site consists of sand and gravel overlying Reading Beds, which in turn overlies chalk. In the eastern part of the site the deposits are highly variable and deeper.     Any alluvial deposits on the site have the potential to contain remains of prehistoric activity and evidence of the local palaeoenvironment. The geological report, however, does not suggest the presence of extensive peat deposits on the site (which may contain such artefactual/ ecofactual evidence).  </value>

This followed a trial trench evaluation which, along with aerial photograph evidence, had identified areas of archaeological potential. Various features were uncovered, including two large Bronze Age ring-ditches, and a smaller one surrounding a group of urned and un-urned cremations. Cremations were also found within the northern ring-ditch and a few in isolated positions just to the west of the ring-ditches. Central to the northern ring-ditch was an upturned biconical urn covering the cremated remains of a 35-40 year old male, which may represent the monument's primary burial.    The southern ring-ditch provided a focus for four pagan Anglo-Saxon inhumations located around the western side of the ditch. One male, two females and another individual dating from the 7th century were represented along with grave goods of beads, rings, knives and a pot of Merovingian origin.     Medieval deposits were largely confined to the south western corner of the site, consisting of ditches, pits, post-holes and an oven. These appear to form a probable agricultural complex. At least two structures were identified, but these were probably farm buildings rather than dwellings.     Away from the ring-ditches, prehistoric features were sparse but one isolated pit with Late Neolithic Grooved Ware was located. Prehistoric evidence dating back as far as the Mesolithic was present throughout the site but mainly as unstratified or residual finds. It was also noted that significant depths of silty subsoil deposits had built up since the Roman period. </value>

The results have revealed a sequence of Shepperton Gravel overlain by peat and alluvium, capped by varying thicknesses of made ground. Two boreholes were collected from the route. Collectively, the sedimentary sequences from these sequences indicate deposition between the Early Mesolithic and Bronze Age cultural periods. During this time, the biostratigraphic records indicate the transition from birch and pine woodland growing under cool climatic conditions to the growth of mixed deciduous woodland on the dryland and alder fen carr on the floodplain during the later Mesolithic and Neolithic, before a decline of woodland during the Bronze Age in response to relative sea level change and woodland clearance for settlement and agricultural purposes.</value>

The majority of the A217 section was undertaken in the carriageway. Evidence of earlier road construction was observed in the outside lane of the southbound carriageway and in a single trial-hole located at the Dorking Road roundabout.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between 18th February 2014 and 21st February 2014 Oxford Archaeology East carried out an archaeological evaluation on land north of Stonehouse Road, Salhouse, Norfolk (TG 29933 15550). Five 50m long trenches and two 25m long trenches were excavated, targeting anomalies identified on a geophysical survey within two fields (GSB 2013). A possible Middle Bronze Age enclosure, a Middle Bronze Age boundary ditch, possible Iron Age ring gullies, Roman pits, an undated well and undated boundary ditches were found in the trenches within the southern field. Trenches in the northern field were found to contain no archaeology.   An assemblage of pottery dating from Late Neolithic through to Iron Age was recovered from features on site, as well as a small assemblage of worked flints indicative of tool use as opposed to production, including a long end scraper dated to the Mesolithic.</value>

A total of 17 trenches were excavated. In two areas of deep peat, 14 trenches were excavated by machine, in order to establish the presence/absence of concealed archaeological deposits. A further three trenches were excavated by hand, in order to establish the character and extent of two previously identified archaeological features: a rock shelter (Site 02), and a possible structure/enclosure (Site 03).  The evaluation did not reveal any evidence for archaeological deposits in the areas of deep peat. In addition, the possible structure/enclosure (Site 03) was shown to be a natural accumulation of boulders, with no evidence for archaeological deposits. It is therefore recommended that no further mitigation is required in these areas.  The rock shelter (Site 02) has been shown to be a significant archaeological site, with evidence of early prehistoric activity. The finds indicate that the site is likely to be Mesolithic or Neolithic. It is therefore recommended that the route of the access track be amended to avoid the rock shelter and surrounding area. Furthermore, a buffer zone should established around this area during the construction of the turbine and access route.</value>

The work resulted in the discovery of a single pit, which contained numerous fragments of worked flint, of probable Mesolithic date. The pit was thought to be a tree-throw, which may have been utilised as a shelter during flint working or else it had occurred nearby while the tree was still standing and the flint incorporated when the tree fell, at a later date. A background scatter of abraded Roman and medieval pottery was also recovered.

<value columnNumber="1">This archaeological desk-based assessment was commissioned as part of the  consideration of demolition and new building work at St. George's Farm, Old  Windsor, Berkshire.  This study highlights the potential for archaeological remains relating to the  prehistoric periods within the entire area of the estate. Artefacts dating from the  Mesolithic, through the Neolithic, Bronze Age and into the Iron Age show a  continued use of the river and its environs.  While Roman remains are known in the area the chance of them being present in the  site is though to be low. It is likely the area was under agriculture during this  period. Field systems of this date are known to the northeast and there is the  potential for a farm to the south.  A Saxon Royal Palace is located just to the south of the site. There is a high  possibility that a nucleated settlement radiating from the church and associated with  the palace could potentially lie within the site boundary.  Archaeological remains of the post-medieval period are unlikely to be present in the  area.  The entire area lies with a Scheduled Ancient Monument and this is legally  protected.

<value columnNumber="1">Pre-Construct Archaeological Services Ltd (PCAS) carried out an archaeological evaluation on land to the south of Steetley Lane, Holme Carr Farm, near Worksop, Nottinghamshire.  The site has been subject to previous archaeological investigations, in the form of a desk-based assessment, fieldwalking and a geophysical survey. Cropmarks identified from aerial photographs suggested the presence of buried ditches defining two possible enclosures, and at least one of these enclosures and an associated field system was confirmed by the geophysical survey. Fieldwalking identified a small amount of worked flint dating from the Mesolithic to Bronze Age. A small amount of Romano-British and late medieval pottery was also recovered. Seven trenches were excavated to investigate features identified by geophysical survey. Buried ditches were confirmed at two locations and backfilled quarry pits were also identified. A well preserved Romano-British copper alloy brooch was recovered from one ditch and three sherds of Romano-British pottery were recovered from the subsoil around the location of the enclosure confirmed by geophysical survey, collectively indicating that it and the associated field system are probably of Romano-British date. Many features identified within the trenches could not be shown to be of human origin and appeared to be the product of fracturing of the bedrock, by weathering or tree roots. Notably, a large circular cropmark, interpreted as the second possible enclosure, produced no evidence of human action in its creation.  </value>

Consequently, Mr David Gibbons commissioned Oxford Archaeology North (OA North) to carry out an archaeological evaluation in accordance with a formal brief issued by the Lancashire County Archaeology Service (LCAS).  The outlined development area is currently laid down to arable, and positioned to the east of Bank Farm, approximately 500m to the north of Gorst Lane and adjacent to Langley's Brook. The area of the proposed lake is close to four separate findspots of prehistoric worked flint in the Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) (PRN nos. 4156, 4158, 4159, 4161), and a Bronze Age stone axe hammer (PRN 2032). This has been taken to indicate occupation and use of the area during the Mesolithic through to the Bronze Age period. In addition, a number of unidentified and undated cropmarks (PRNs 2810, 4443, 4444, 4445) are present, but are likely to relate to old field boundaries.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A watching brief took place on 1.7km of EDF electric cable trench and 3 transformers. The majority of the route was located on the Greensand ridge and here cable was laid by mole-plough allowing limited opportunities for investigation. Worked flint dating to the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods was observed in ploughed fields. No features relating to the prehistoric period were encountered during excavation.  Two undated drainage features, 5m apart were revealed during open cut excavation carried out along the eastern side of 'Hammer Meadow', a field containing channels and earthworks relating to post-medieval water management.  Both features were wide flat bottomed ditches with sloping sides. One, fully silted-up, contained the remains of several logs in the base, with a later narrower re-cut containing a chalk fill and some evidence of possible ditch clearance. The second ditch, probably the later feature, contained a substantial stone culvert. The location suggests it channelled water into one of the main water channels, still evident today.  Previous investigation suggests local water meadows and the hammer pond at Abinger Mill were allowed controlled seasonal releases of water from the Tillingbourne stream from the 17th to the 19th century.  Evidence of a small water channel, which may represent an original tributary of the Tillingbourne stream was recorded in the car park of 'Grant House' the location of the now demolished mill.   </value>

A single Mesolithic or Early Neolithic flint artefact was found and evidence of Iron Age and Roman activity was identified. Very little dating evidence was recovered and it has not been possible to separate Iron Age and Roman features. Two different field systems or enclosure ditch alignments were recorded, as had been previously indicated by a geophysical survey and evaluation. A series of parallel ditches crossing the site appear to be respected by one of the field systems. The ditches are sited at the change of slope, with lower ground to the north containing no identified evidence for enclosures. Although the parallel ditches have the appearance of flanking ditches beside a trackway, a gully crossed the intervening space at one phase, and there is a possibility that the multiple ditches formed a boundary rather than marking a trackway. Following Roman activity on the site, the land became one of Winteringham's open fields, and the evaluation identified ridge and furrow on a single alignment.  </value>

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green.

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the findings of an archaeological evaluation conducted by NPS Archaeology ahead of proposed development at the Ferry Boat, 191 King Street, Norwich. Commissioned by Norwich Backpackers, the evaluation revealed a complex sequence of well preserved archaeological remains at the site.   The evaluation consisted of two trenches each 4m by 4m in plan that were positioned within the footprint of the proposed development which covered an area of c 1,280m2. Trench 1 lay close to the King Street frontage. In the base of the trench undisturbed geological sands with gravels were overlain by a deposit interpreted as a possible prehistoric soil. Worked flints recovered as residual finds provided evidence for the earliest human activity at the site, perhaps as early as the Mesolithic or Upper Palaeolithic periods.   The earliest features at the site were pits and a possible structural feature. Pottery from these features suggested they were of 11th century date. No function for these features was identified. Sealing these features were surfaces of crushed chalk, ash, sand and clay with patches of burning thought to be associated with industrial rather than domestic activity. The complexity of these deposits indicated regular use and repair. Though no contemporary structural remains were identified, the fragile nature of these surfaces inferred they were present within a building. Pottery recovered from the earliest floor sequence indicated it was in use in the 11th to 12th centuries. Continuity in 'industrial' activity at the site was suggested by at least two clear phases of chalk floors being identified. The chalk floors and any associated structure appeared to have been replaced in the medieval period by a masonry building with a clay floor. Cutting this floor were pits of possibly late medieval date, sealed below activity associated with 19th and 20th century use of the site.   </value>

This comprised the excavation of nine areas, totalling C8840m2. In addition, a further six evaluation trenches were opened.   Prehistoric activity was restricted to a cluster of pits and a ditch in Area 4 dated to the middle-late Iron Age on the basis of associated pottery. Environmental samples from these features produced a useful assemblage of charred plant remains and charcoal, especially as the region is noted for a lack of analysed later prehistoric archaeobotanical remains.  Earlier activity in the area was suggested by the discovery of an early Bronze Age barbed-and-tanged arrowhead and two late Mesolithic/early Neolithic bladelets found in an Iron Age pit. No further Bronze Age activity was discovered, despite the presence of an urned early or middle Bronze Age cremation deposit found during the evaluation. The earlier evaluation also discovered two early to middle Saxon pits. No further evidence of this date was uncovered during the present excavation.  A trackway and a number of linear ditches probably relating to field divisions were discovered.

In addition, occasional flint artefacts from the Mesolithic to early Neolithic periods  were found as residual finds in some of the features.  The features of late Bronze Age to early Iron Age date were found largely in the  eastern part of the site. Possible settlement sites were identified in the south-east  corner and close to a palaeochannel in the north of the site. Occasional isolated  features of this date elsewhere across the site may attest to a broader agricultural  landscape.  There were a number of ditches that probably date to the medieval and postmedieval  periods. There is a suggestion that some boundaries may be the remnants  of strip fields with a slightly curved form and could represent a medieval field  system. The site continued in agricultural use in the post-medieval period and  evidence of relatively sophisticated drainage features dating to the early 19th  century were recorded.  </value>

The evaluation was  commissioned by Andy Clark of Ingrebourne Valley Ltd and was undertaken in  compliance with a planning condition required by the London Borough of Havering  and attached to planning consent for the construction of a golf course and re-profile of  the site.  During rescue excavations undertaken in 1979, features dating to the Palaeolithic,  Mesolithic and Neolithic periods as well as a Bronze Age cemetery were uncovered.  Evidence of Romano-British and medieval settlement have also been identified in the  area. During a recent evaluation of Phases I and II of the current site (McCall 2009)  prehistoric features were recorded in the eastern part of the site, and medieval  features were recorded at the southern end of the site. Archaeological monitoring  recorded additional medieval remains (Pozorski 2010). Therefore the site had a  potential for prehistoric and medieval archaeological remains.  In the event the current evaluation revealed two small pits, one of ?prehistoric date,  and two linear features. The latter were probably part of the same modern feature,  and likely a ditch.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological investigation was undertaken on the route of the 94.09 km Pannal to Nether Kellet gas pipeline constructed during 2006 and 2007. Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green. The late medieval to post-medieval industrial past of the region was represented by an iron smelting bloomery furnace, three early brick clamps and ten kilns, for lime-burning or other functions, excavated in Lower and Upper Wharfedale.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Mott MacDonald were commissioned by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) to undertake an archaeological watching brief during Ground Investigation works in advance of proposed redevelopment within the Leuchars Station military base in Fife. The works involved excavation of a series of geotechnical trial pits focussed within the Garden and Designed Landscape (GDL) associated with nearby Earlshall, a Category A Listed Building of mid-16th century date. DIO are proposing to re-purpose the former RAF Leuchars airbase (now known as Leuchars Station) to better suit the requirements of the army.  Discussions with the Fife Council Archaeology Officer confirmed the archaeological sensitivity of the site. There is strong evidence for prehistoric activity in the area around Leuchars Station, and in particular the Eden estuary where Mesolithic shell middens have been found. Leuchars has been an airbase and subsequently an army barracks since the early 20th century. As such, the site has survived much of the deep mechanised ploughing that has taken place through modern agricultural development. The absence of deep ploughing means that any archaeological deposits surviving within the limits of Leuchars Station may be well preserved and undamaged.   The trial pits excavated at Leuchars Station were limited in scope and failed to reveal any significant archaeological deposits or artefacts. A total of 14 trial pits were monitored across the Earlshall GDL.  It is recommended that a programme of archaeological evaluation be completed in advance of any significant works within Leuchars Station where it can be proved that the locations of such works have previously been undisturbed by 20th and 21st century development. However, it is not anticipated further works will be required as part of this project.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">During the late 1950s when New Guy's House, which abuts the site to the north, was being built, a channel, now referred to as Guy's Channel, was identified. Within the channel, and just within the northern edges of the site, sections of a Roman shallow bottomed boat were recovered during archaeological excavations. The area where the boat was found to the north is now a Scheduled Monument, LO 157. A previous evaluation in 2010 successfully relocated the Guy's boat. Subsequently two evaluation trenches were excavated by MOLA in September and October 2011, Trench A and Trench B. The results of this Phase 2 field evaluation have helped to refine the initial assessment of the site and demonstrated that a sequence of fluvial deposits with the earliest possibly contemporary with the Roman boat are present in the eastern Trench B. The presence of fluvial deposits in this area was unforeseen as it was thought to lie outside of the channel. Although waterlain deposits were present in the western Trench A, they are likely to be much older than the Roman watercourse and to represent the Late glacial or Early Holocene (Late Upper Palaeolithic or Mesolithic) floodplain, and consequently to have been outside the Roman channel. The higher fluvial deposits in Trench B extend into the medieval and post medieval period and were post-dated by a number of ditches. The majority of the later activity in both trenches largely consisted of the dumping of masses of finds rich domestic rubbish during the late 17th and 18th century, including pottery and clay tobacco pipes. </value>

As a result the monitoring of stripping of topsoil and subsoil focused on an undisturbed area of land to the east, in close proximity to the archaeological features identified in 1999. The watching brief  was undertaken by ULAS on a number of visits (see Appendix). A number of pits, post-holes and linear features were revealed dating to the prehistoric/ Iron Age, possibly suggesting a continuation of later prehistoric settlement.

No pre-modern archaeological features or finds were observed.    Holocene alluvium was found in borehole BH120 below made ground and a section of the core at -24.85 to -25.24mOD was analysed. Pollen evidence indicates oak and hazel woodland and an acorn cup produced a 14C date of 9030-8720 BP (late Mesolithic).  Abundant charcoal suggests human activity or natural fires. Plant and animal remains indicate gradual marine inundation, with brackish intertidal creeks developing.    During cable laying offshore in 2010, the previously unreported wreck of a small wooden vessel in poor condition was encountered at approximate position 450546 E, 5741447 N (UTM Zone 31N). Archaeological evaluation suggests that the unidentified wreck was exposed by sandwave migration after 2008. It probably dates to the late nineteenth or twentieth century and was probably a small fishing or recreational boat or World War II patrol or service boat.    During cable burial operations off the Isle of Grain in 2010, part of a previously unreported wooden wreck was discovered in the cable trench at approximate position 346411 E, 5705324 N (UTM Zone 31N).

Arthur's Stone lies within a prehistoric landscape with features dating from the Mesolithic and Neolithic period, the monument itself is believed to date to between 3,500-2,400 BC (5,500-4,400 BP).  The work was undertaken as part of Scheduled Monument Consent relating to repairs to the monument's perimeter fence. The work encompassed production of contour and hachure plans the excavation of eight fence post-holes which were subsequently profiled using a magnetic susceptibility meter. A dry-stone wall that formed part of the outer wall of the monument was located by the excavation of a post-hole on the south-east side of the mound. The finding of the wall is significant as this feature was not previously known to exist, and it adds to the understanding of the monument. The wall can be compared with a similar feature, which is part of Bach Long Barrow, located 5km to the west of Dorstone.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A geoarchaeological evaluation was carried out on core samples recovered from boreholes drilled through alluvial sediments and peat deposits of the river Thames at the east end of the Royal Albert Dock. Radiocarbon dating dates the sequence from the late Mesolithic to the early medieval periods, and analysis of pollen and ostracods/diatoms enabled changes in the riverside environment and sea level to be reconstructed. Braided river gravels (Shepperton Gravel) were laid down 20,000-11,600 years ago, and after an apparent  hiatus in deposition seal level rose and marine-estuarine deposits began to be laid down in the late Mesolithic, c. 6800 years ago. A regression of the sea from the site occured in the early Neolithic, c. 6290-6170 years ago, probably as a result of sea-level rises being outstripped by peat growth, but a true fall in sea level occured during the Neolithic. Sea level rose once more and the peat was again covered with marine-estuarine sediments during the middle Bronze Age, c. 3730 and 3550 years ago. Archaeological evidence for a fall in sea level in the early Roman period , followed by a rise, is reflected in the development of a thin peat deposit during the Roman period, followed by renewed marine sedimentation in the late Roman/Saxon periods. Pollen evidence shows an elm decline in the early Neolithic c. 6290-6170 years ago, in common with other sites in south-east England. The later lime decline is dated to the middle to late Bronze Age, c. 3730-3550 years ago, and this appears to co-incide with the first appearance of cereal-type pollen and Pteridum spores, suggestive of forest clearance and arable farming. Tree pollen frequiencies decline from the Iron Age onwards, indicating a more open environment, and arable cuiltivation continued through the Roman into the Saxon period. Finally reedswamp environments became established at or near the site.</value>

The results were used to enhance a deposit model of the natural topography of the site, which was supplemented by borehole data held by the British Geological Survey. There is potential for the survival of archaeological remains of prehistoric to post medieval date in a landsurface that follows the sloping hillside, on which the Saxon monastery stood, towards the river. On the riverwards side of a cliff / shoreline a very deep (up to 25m) sequence of predominantly sandy estuarine deposits exist that also date from the Mesolithic period onwards. Pollen and plant macro-remains suggest the Saxon hillside would have been open, grassy and possibly used for pasture, although areas of scrub and woodland and some cultivated ground also existed nearby. . The Saxon river would have consisted of shifting tidal channels and sand banks. The shoreline in the Saxon period lay closer to the church than it does today. A low Limestone cliff defined the edge of the river just upstream and to the south east of the monastery. A rocky beach probably existed to the south of the monastery, but the cliff appears to have been absent along the shoreline to the south west, where the hillside sloped down to a beach or foreshore that lay within an inlet, possibly created where a tributary stream flowed down the hillside into the Wear.</value>

Although the site has been the object of the attention of a number of archaeologists and natural scientists over the past century, there had never been a thorough survey of the site nor had modern dating techniques been rigorously employed in any study. In 1981 Dr Roger Jacobi of the University of Lancaster informed the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments that what little remained of this important site was being actively eroded. The midden site is normally buried beneath beach sand and is approximately 400m from the sea wall at a depth of -2.4m OD. It is only exposed at low spring tides and at periods when much of the covering sand is scoured from the beach through a combination of tides, currents and gales. The unpredictable nature of this exposure, which occurs only once or twice in a two-year period, presented considerable organisational difficulties for the Central Excavation Unit sampling exercise, particularly as it was important to have as many specialists on site during the work as possible.</value>

Beneath this medieval layer was a partially degraded horizon of peat. A sample from this layer indicated a late Mesolithic date.

The building was constructed about 1930 as the 'Brownlow Arms' public house, replacing a public house of the same name, constructed about 1865-70.

The boreholes were drilled with a cable percussion rig to the surface of the Pleistocene sand and gravel deposits in order to recover a complete sequence of the Holocene floodplain deposits.   A total of five facies were identified from Pleistocene gravels through early Holocene sands and clays to peats, the remnants of an alder dominated floodplain forest, and finally estuarine muds as sea levels changed and the Thames at this location became subject to tidal influences.    The borehole survey confirmed the picture presented by a previous geoarchaeological deposit model of an undulating gravel topography of channels and promontories, a legacy of the Pleistocene Thames and possibly former courses of the Beam and other tributaries, which were likely to have formed an important part of the prehistoric landscape, providing routes of access into the wetland areas of the Thames.     The palaeoenvironmental assessment coupled with radiocarbon dating provided an important insight into the composition and appearance of a Late Mesolithic / early Neolithic floodplain forest and a record changing hydrology and relative sea level rise. Evidence for the waterlogging of former dry landsurfaces and early Bronze Age estuarine incursion overwhelming the floodplain forest provided specific and dateable information about the impact of rising river levels and later estuarine encroachment.   </value>

Two areas, covering a total of 0.7ha were opened. Area A was situated to the north of the partition wall that subdivided the development area whilst Area B lay to its south. Evidence for human activity spanning the Mesolithic to Medieval periods was recovered, although features directly associated with settlement appeared to date predominantly to the Iron Age and were concentrated toward the southern end of Area B. These comprised boundary ditches and gullies, pits and a very large number of postholes, some of which were concentrated into clusters that appeared to represent the sites of repeated construction, probably of fairly temporary structures. Three cremations dating to the Middle Bronze Age were recorded in Area A. Two inhumations also recovered from Area A were tentatively dated to the Roman period. A number of sherds of Saxon pottery were recorded across the site but of particular significance was the recovery of a sherd of imported North French Blackware. This was an extremely rare find in the county, with Chatteris being just the third site to produce such material.

Subsequent flooding of the area was resolved through further reclamation in the 17th century and use  of the land for agricultural purposes, which continued into the 18th century/early 19th century, when the land was used to construct a building, used for industrial purposes in the early 19th century.</value>

In addition there was evdence of small-scale landscape usage during the Mesolithic and EBA. Subtantial MBA activity was found, including open settlement, enclosures, four ring ditches, two with cremations, isolated cremations and a single crouched inhumation. During the LBA there was dispersed unenclosed settlement with wells, four/six poster structures. The area appears to have been abandoned in the EIA until the LIA, when a single settlement was established. During the Roman period several routes were established along with several burial areas. The area of settlment peaked in the mid 2C AD, with one settlement abandoned after this time and and second declining in the 4C AD.

The NGR for the centre of the site is 550714 182512.Ten geoarchaeological boreholes were undertaken at Beam Reach running broadly east to west across the site. The boreholes were drilled with a cable percussion rig to the surface of the Pleistocene sand and gravel deposits in order to recover a complete sequence of the Holocene floodplain deposits.   A total of five facies were identified from Pleistocene gravels through early Holocene sands and clays to peats, the remnants of an alder dominated floodplain forest, and finally estuarine muds as sea levels changed and the Thames at this location became subject to tidal influences.    The borehole survey confirmed the picture presented by a previous geoarchaeological deposit model of an undulating gravel topography of channels and promontories, a legacy of the Pleistocene Thames and possibly former courses of the Beam and other tributaries, which were likely to have formed an important part of the prehistoric landscape, providing routes of access into the wetland areas of the Thames.     The palaeoenvironmental assessment coupled with radiocarbon dating provided an important insight into the composition and appearance of a Late Mesolithic / early Neolithic floodplain forest and a record changing hydrology and relative sea level rise. Evidence for the waterlogging of former dry landsurfaces and early Bronze Age estuarine incursion overwhelming the floodplain forest provided specific and dateable information about the impact of rising river levels and later estuarine encroachment.   </value>

Six trenches (total area 216 sq m) were excavated, representing approximately 4% of the area most affected by the proposed development.    The natural stratum was sand and gravel (of glaciofluvial or river terrace origin) with a slight downward slope from west to east. It was overlaid by generally thin and discontinuous subsoil deposits of loose sand and gravel.    Two undated linear features were recorded in the north-western part of the site, cutting the natural sand and sealed by a subsoil deposit. One was irregular in plan and profile and was not obviously man-made. The other was more regular in shape with a ditch-like profile. The fills of both features were similar to the overlying subsoil and neither of them produced any finds. It is unclear therefore whether these features were of natural or man-made origin.    A residual worked flint of Mesolithic or Neolithic date was found in an overlying soil horizon and provides the only clear evidence for prehistoric activity in the vicinity of the site.    Subsoil deposits were overlaid by worked soil horizons and a buried topsoil layer.

<value columnNumber="1">Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd submitted a proposal to develop a large area of semi-rural land on the south-eastern fringe of Rochdale, Greater Manchester (SD 9180 1200). The development proposal allows for the construction of a new industrial estate, and necessitates the destruction of rural dwellings and other relict landscape features, some which date to the 17th century and earlier. An archaeological condition was attached to the planning consent, and a brief detailing the required archaeological works was devised by the Assistant County Archaeologist for Greater Manchester. In the first instance, a desk-based assessment of the development area was undertaken, which identified several sites of historical and archaeological interest; followed by a programme of building survey. Targeted archaeological evaluation, coupled with limited photographic, topographic, and palaeoenvironmental survey, which was undertaken by Oxford Archaeology North (OA North). The results of the evaluation led to the detailed excavation of ten post-medieval farmsteads by OA North, a watching brief, and a programme of targeted palaeoenvironmental assessment. Palaeoenvironmental data recovered from the site has potential to provide an excellent record of vegetation change in relation to anthropogenic activity between the Mesolithic and Bronze Age periods. The development of this area since the medieval period is represented by a diverse range of landscape features, including ridge and furrow cultivation, routeways and farmsteads. The results obtained from the excavation of ten post-medieval farmsteads provide a rare opportunity to examine the development of such structures. Several distinct types of farm buildings have been recognised, including laithe-houses, L-shaped and combination layouts, together with purpose-built weavers' cottages and a labourer's tenement.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">MoLAS and PCA monitored the excavation of geotechnical trail pits, window samples and boreholes at the site.  The deposits observed within the trial pits and window samples indicate the presence of 19th to 20th century dumping of industrial waste (from varied industrial activities such as furnace works, glass works and also possible gas works waste) across the whole site. Finds evidence suggests that it probably dates from the first quarter of the 20th century. The deposit has a depth of between 7m and 11m below current ground level. Underlying this were deposits with palaeoenvironmental or archaeological potential: an active flowing channel of the Lea flowed through this area at least until the Late Mesolithic\Early Neolithic periods. The length of time that the channel was active and the subsequent development of the alluvial clays has implications for the survival and occurrence of human occupation. The overlying alluvial clays suggest that a mudflat environment developed once channel migration had occurred. A large expanse of mudflats would not have been an attractive location for later prehistoric occupation. </value>

The main period of occupation could be dated to the Late Bronze Age. It consisted of the construction of a large ditched enclosure, c.35m in diameter, which may have had an internal bank. A mass of pits, postholes and other cut features were recorded both inside and outside of the enclosure. Possible structures located internally included a roundhouse, a palisaded screen, four-post structures and hearths. Immediately outside the west-facing entranceway was a further palisaded screen, four-post structures and an elaborate hearth or fire-pit. Pottery recovered from features across the enclosure overwhelmingly comprised plainware of the post Deverel-Rimbury tradition, dateable to 10th-9th centuries BC, of the Late Bronze Age. The morphology of the enclosure and the nature of its related features suggests that it belongs to the class of Late Bronze Age enclosures termed 'aggrandised enclosures' by David Yates (1999) or 'Springfield style enclosures' in the Monument Protection Program definition of this type of site (www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/intro2.htm) after the type site at Springfield Lyons in Essex (Buckley and Hedges 1987).

Four test pits measuring 1m x 1m were excavated by hand through topsoil to investigate the  incidence of Mesolithic artefacts in the topsoil. A small trench extension, measuring 10m x 25m, was stripped over the remains of a suspected Mesolithic working floor first identified, in trench 47, during the trenching evaluation.    The hand-dug test pits revealed significant incidence of worked Mesolithic flints in the topsoil, as well as burnt flint and prehistoric, Roman and medieval pottery. All the pottery recovered was abraded and the prehistoric pottery was consistent in date with that recovered from features during the trial trenching evaluation. The remaining pottery is general background material that has been moved around the landscape by ploughing and other human action.    The trench extension confirmed the existence of at least one Mesolithic deposit and revealed four Stake-holes sealed by it. These results confirm the findings of the previous evaluation, in that tangible Mesolithic remains survive within the site which is potentially of high importance. The distribution of the Mesolithic flints further suggests that the identifiable Mesolithic activity is confined to the south-central and south-western parts of the site.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An evaluation consisting of forty-three trenches and fifty-seven test pits was carried out on, and in the vicinity of, two Mesolithic and Neolithic flint scatters. These scatters were located either side of a former fenland embayment on the slightly higher ground of the March 'island'. A buried soil sealed by later alluvium contained a quantity of Mesolithic flint as did a handful of features recorded beneath it. This buried soil also contained a Neolithic leaf-shaped arrowhead. An auger survey and pollen analysis indicated that in Mesolithic times the buried soil would have been in a cleared area beside a small stream which was later subject to the inundation of the fenland saltmarsh as water levels rose. A number of post-medieval linear features were also recorded.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The excavation revealed remains dating from the Mesolithic through to the post-medieval period. Significant features were limited to the later Neolithic or early Bronze Age, the early Iron Age and the later Iron Age. The  remains indicate that during the later Neolithic or early Bronze Age a rectilinear enclosure was established at the site. Beaker pottery and struck flint were recovered. No domestic features were encountered despite the pottery possibly being of a domestic type and it seems likely that either such features had not survived or were sited beyond the limits of the excavation. A droveway defined by parallel drainage ditches, with an enclosure appended to it were in use at the site during the early Iron Age, a system of gates or barriers apparently regulating the movement of livestock between the enclosure and the droveway. The small pottery assemblage from the droveway indicates that it was probably active in the period 600-350BC. At least thirty-seven charcoal-filled pits encountered at the site, which have been interpreted as charcoal clamps, post-dated the droveway and probably date to the later Iron Age. The number of clamps indicates the frequent or prolonged use of the site for the manufacture of charcoal.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A series of archaeological investigations were undertaken at Little Dartmouth Farm in advance of agricultural and domestic development. Excavations within the footprint of the new agricultural building revealed a number of prehistoric features, none of which conformed to any readily-discernible plan or pattern. These features included a large, deep pit containing multiple re-cuts all dating to the late Mesolithic. A large pond-like feature, thought to be a midden, was also identified. This contained flint-knapping waste and a range of flint tools dominated by scrapers and arrowheads and yielded radiocarbon dates clustered in the 19th century cal BC. These two features are almost unparalleled, but the closest comparable examples have been excavated at Stonehenge and Durrington Walls. A range of other, smaller features were also excavated, one of which contained several sherds of decorated Beaker pottery together with charcoal that was dated to the 22nd or 23rd century cal BC. Other features on the site produced two possible stone axe roughouts. Petrological analysis has confirmed the roughouts came from the cliffs above the Dancing Beggars, indicating the presence of an axe production site nearby. No trace of the oval enclosure was detected during the limited topsoil stripping that took place in the field to the south-west of the farm buildings, but the archaeological features and finds excavated at Little Dartmouth suggest it might be a hengiform monument.</value>

In compliance with an approved WSI (CA 2017a),  an area of 1.11ha was excavated across the development area.  A series of intercutting enclosure and drainage ditches were  identified across site, which were dated to the Late Iron Age and  Roman period. At the north of the excavated area, the site was the  focus for two successive large enclosures, each of which contained  a number of intercutting amorphous ditches, possibly relating to  enclosures and/or drainage. The site was bisected by a substantial  palaeochannel, which was canalised during the Roman period, and  many of the ditches may have related to water management. At the  south-west of the site two ditch alignments may have been part of a  trackway, and some regular ditches possibly related to structures.  Residual pottery of late prehistoric date and a small assemblage of  residual worked flints, some likely of Mesolithic or Early Neolithic  date, suggest prehistoric activity in the general area.  Notable finds included fineware ceramics, many Roman coins,  brooches and other metalwork, forming an assemblage of  unusually rich character for a typical Roman rural site. This  suggests the excavated area may have been associated with a  high status settlement and/or a site with a religious focus.</value>

A previous evaluation recorded 12th - 14th century features, including several large pits and gullies located adjacent to the road.    The results of the excavation show seven distinct phases:    Phase I (12000BC - 42AD) - residual prehistoric finds dating to the Mesolithic and late prehistoric periods recovered from medieval features.  Phase II (42AD - 410AD) comprised two Roman features dating from the late 1st to mid-second century AD which were located in the eastern area of the site.   Phase III (11th - 12thC AD) related to a period of limited activity relating to the partition of the site with a main boundary ditch.  Phase IV (12th - 13thC AD) quarry pitting for the exploitation of clay, and infilled with domestic waste. All of the extraction pits with the exception of one contained faunal remains, likely the result of domestic food preparation. The environmental evidence showed a mixed agrarian economy was prevalent during this phase.  Phase V (12th - 14thC AD) relates to the formalisation and demarcation of a possible late medieval roadside plot or 'toft and croft' style holding.   Phase VI (15th - 17thC AD) relates to agricultural farming activity (ridge and furrow) recorded in the southern half of the site, away from the roadside plot established in Phase V. The features in Phase VI show a distinct demarcation in activity between the northern and southern halves of the site.  Phase VII (19th - 20thC AD) recorded building activity associated with Quay's Farm to the east of the site (  The most significant phases are Phases IV (12th - 13th C), V (12th - 14th C) and VI (15th - 17th C) relating to activity associated with the extraction of clay at the site followed by development of a roadside plot and finally agricultural use.  </value>

A programme of archaeological trial trenching carried out within the Site has identified archaeological remains mainly dating to the Late Iron Age, early Roman, medieval and post-medieval periods.   This assessment demonstrates that there is the potential for surviving archaeological remains within the Site, in particular those dating to the Late Iron Age, Roman and medieval periods. The majority of the Site has been subject to little modern disturbance. As a result, any archaeological deposits are likely to be in a good state of preservation, although they may have been affected by arable farming practises dating from the medieval and post-medieval periods.

The proposed development area occupies a low ridge aligned north-west / south-east bounded on the north-east by the East Stour and on the south-west by the Bilham and Ruckinge Dykes.    The evaluation has identified the presence of archaeological remains, spanning several periods across the six areas with the exception of the central northern region of Area 2. Activity appears to be confined to the Prehistoric and the broad Iron Age /Romano-British transition period. Some possible early activity is attested to by the recovery of Mesolithic worked flint from a Palaeochannel identified in Trench 58 (Area 2) and features sampled in the western part of Area 6 (possibly Neolithic in date). Some features in Area 5 which have produced Romano-British artefacts in their upper fills could possibly be of earlier origin.   Further archaeological investigation will prove the function of the features within all areas particularly the form and function of the enclosure systems in Areas 1, 2, 3 and 5.

Targeted archaeological evaluation, coupled with limited photographic, topographic, and palaeoenvironmental survey, which was undertaken by Oxford Archaeology North (OA North). The results of the evaluation led to the detailed excavation of ten post-medieval farmsteads by OA North, a watching brief, and a programme of targeted palaeoenvironmental assessment. Palaeoenvironmental data recovered from the site has potential to provide an excellent record of vegetation change in relation to anthropogenic activity between the Mesolithic and Bronze Age periods. The development of this area since the medieval period is represented by a diverse range of landscape features, including ridge and furrow cultivation, routeways and farmsteads. The results obtained from the excavation of ten post-medieval farmsteads provide a rare opportunity to examine the development of such structures. Several distinct types of farm buildings have been recognised, including laithe-houses, L-shaped and combination layouts, together with purpose-built weavers' cottages and a labourer's tenement.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A programme of archaeological evaluation and excavation was undertaken by AOC Archaeology Group at St. Bede's School, Long Cross, Bristol.  The earliest phase of activity identified on site occurred during the Mesolithic period, represented by a small assemblage of residual flints, suggestive of sporadic activity during this period. Evidence for later activity was present in the form of a sequence of Late Iron Age to Early Romano-British roundhouses, replaced by a large enclosure ditch. After a hiatus, activity on site resumed in the in the 3rd to 4th century primarily represented by a sequence of boundary ditches forming part of a larger field system. This, in turn, was also replaced by a large enclosure ditch. In addition to the field system was a contemporary mettled trackway,  constructed from a large volume of metalworking waste. The only activity to be subsequently identified was a small number of walls and ditches spread extensively across the site, thought to be associated with the 17th to 19th century exploitation of this part of the landscape. Overall, a moderate to high density of archaeological features were identified during the course of the evaluation and excavation deriving from the Mesolithic, Late Iron Age/Early Romano-British, 3rd to 4th century AD and post-medieval periods. As a whole, the site is thought to be of local to regional significance, this is due to the nature of the evidence being able to inform on the Late Iron Age and Romano-British utilisation of the immediate landscape for both settlement and agriculture.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A programme of archaeological works was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology in March and July 2012 at land at Elm Grove Road, Dawlish, Devon. Eight trenches were excavated.  The trenches were targeted on anomalies recorded during a previous geophysical survey. The only artefactual material found within a cut feature came from a pit which possibly correlated with a discrete geophysical anomaly. This material comprised two flints of Mesolithic or Neolithic date. The pit may be of Mesolithic/Neolithic date but the possibility that the finds are residual within a later feature can not be discounted.  Four undated ditches corresponding with linear geophysical anomalies were also identified. The lack of artefactual within these ditches suggests that they were field boundaries, and their alignments suggest that the remains of at least two phases of fields may be present. The fact that the anomalies and the excavated ditches are on different alignments to those depicted on cartographic sources suggests that they may be of some antiquity.   In addition to the ditches and pit, two undated possible postholes were identified. No presence of the other geophysical anomalies recorded across the site was identified during the evaluation.   </value>

The fieldwork took place between June 2009 and July 2011 and comprised field walking, survey and excavation.  The field walking identified the location and extent of two large and several minor flint scatters within the dune slack. The fieldwork also identified a former storm-beach, largely buried in wind-blown sand, some 150m inland from the current shoreline. It comprised a deposit of beach pebbles at the foot of a low eroded cliff. Several of the pebbles were flint nodules eroding out of the basal till.   A program of flint collection was carried out on two areas measuring 10m by 20m and 2m by 20m in the vicinity of the storm-beach. There was a clear concentration of struck flints within both areas but none of these were associated with any features.  A few retouched blades from the assemblage were identified as microliths indicating a Mesolithic date for the flint scatters.   </value>

The work was undertaken between 3rd - 27th January 2012. A total of 94 trenches  were excavated across the site.  Evidence was found for activity from three main periods: the earliest spanning the  late Bronze Age to early Iron Age; medieval agricultural use; and post-medieval  activity.  In addition, occasional flint artefacts from the Mesolithic to early Neolithic periods  were found as residual finds in some of the features.  The features of late Bronze Age to early Iron Age date were found largely in the  eastern part of the site. Possible settlement sites were identified in the south-east  corner and close to a palaeochannel in the north of the site. Occasional isolated  features of this date elsewhere across the site may attest to a broader agricultural  landscape.  There were a number of ditches that probably date to the medieval and postmedieval  periods.

It contained eight flakes of later Mesolithic and earlier Neolithic date (Flint Report below) but these finds may be residual.  Sparse finds of struck flint were found within the topsoil, and like that from Ditch F1007 is earlier Neolithic.      Reach is at the northern end of a peninsula jutting into the fen and the northern end of the site extends into the fen.  Peat and alluvial deposits were recorded.

The earliest features on the site are a pair of short Late Bronze Age field boundary ditches.    The main phase of activity identified on the site is from the Middle Iron Age and comprised a sequence of ditches representing the junction of two droveway routes. A number of postholes representing potential buildings or fence lines, and small midden deposits are also dated to this phase of activity.    The presence of Roman pottery within one of the droveway ditches suggests that the transport routes were still in use at this time at a reduced intensity, and it is known that Roman activity in the wider landscape is also much reduced, being focussed on a small settlement enclosure directly to the north of the site. A small group of pits identified close to this enclosure are thought to be associated with its occupation.    The site appears to have fallen out of use after the 1st century AD and there is no further activity until the post medieval period when three undated field boundary ditches are thought to have been used. These were identified as post medieval by stratigraphic relationships and shared orientation with post medieval features in the wider landscape.</value>

The work was undertaken prior to peat restoration works which is understood to include work to areas of both bare and hagged peat, and the blocking of 20th century grips using machine cut peat plugs. Three areas formed part of the survey; the Northern Survey Area; Southern Survey Area 1; and Southern Survey Area 2. The archaeological survey and assessment of landscape palaeoenvironmental potential was designed to augment a pre-intervention record of archaeological remains in the area and to inform the moorland restoration process, highlighting where any unnecessary damage to archaeological features either through the cutting of peat plugs, re-profiling of hags, or through access with tracked excavators, could be avoided.     Known archaeological remains in the area from a search of the Historic Environment Record (HER) and National Trust records are confined mostly to Mesolithic findspots of flint and 19th and 20th century activity, including quarrying and boundary marking.

Intended as an  Outreach and Community project, &amp;#163;2300 was pledged by the Origins Foundation to  fund a programme of outreach activities.

No intact buried soil horizons preserving in-situ Mesolithic or Prehistoric  occupation were identified either by the auger survey or the trial trenches. The  presence of several flakes in the vicinity of the trenches confirms the probability of  Mesolithic hunter-gatherer activity in the location. However, the low density of the  finds indicates that either a) our research has not pin-pointed an exact locus of  occupation or more likely b) the site has been disturbed by later bioturbation and  slope processes. The low density of lithic material is probably indicative of transitory  occupation. Pook's Pulpit is likely to be typical of other localities within the valley where Mesolithic  hunter gatherers, moving through the landscape utilised the rock as setting for short  term camps for short periods of time.

<value columnNumber="1">Excavations carried out by Archaeology South-East on the site of the American Express (Amex) Community Stadium, Falmer, East Sussex have revealed exciting evidence of over 7000 years of human activity.  The earliest occupation found was a Mesolithic camp, centred on a clearing in the woods and where the production of flint tools (microliths) was carried out. The scale of this production is unprecedented in East Sussex. Much of the flintwork was found deposited in five groups of deep pits.  There was little recognisable human activity at the site in the Early and Middle Neolithic periods but geoarchaeological investigations have shown that the landscape continued to change with probable deforestation which caused colluvial deposition within the river valley to the west.     In the Late Neolithic / Early Bronze Age, a large ring ditch was dug, almost in the exact spot as the Mesolithic woodland clearing and mirroring its broadly circular shape.  Subsequently, two further ring ditches were dug on the same alignment as the first.  There are a number of possibilities for what these ring ditches may have been, ranging from circular buildings to henges to the most likely explanation, a barrow group. Whatever their function, the structures were re-visited later in prehistory; a testament to the continued topographic importance of the site.    Finally the site became the focus of Anglo-Saxon habitation including a sunken feature building, in order, perhaps, to shepherd flocks of animals over large distances, and representing a satellite site to the large areas of similarly dated occupation to the east and west.  </value>

A limited assemblage of domestic material was deposited in these features.    Physical evidence for the use of the site as a tannery dates to the 18th and 19th centuries, when the site also appears to have been sub-divided with ditches, again also acting as drainage. Some domestic material was also deposited in pits at this time. A block of tannery pits were active at this time, occupying much of the site; there are cartographic and documentary references to the presence of a tannery/fellmongery at the site at this time, and for the location of buildings.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The proposed development Site lies on the northern fringe of the historic City of Cambridge, in the parish of Milton. There are no Scheduled Monuments or Listed Buildings within the Site. Quarrying of the river terrace gravels in the area has brought to light Palaeolithic hand axes and there is evidence of Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic worked flint from the alluvial flats on the other side of the River Cam.  Although situated on the margins of settlement today this was not necessarily always the case as there is evidence of Late Iron Age and Roman settlement in close proximity. There is also the possibility of Late Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon burials being present in the southern part of the Site.  The Site is thought to have been fields from the Medieval period up until the mid 19thcentury when the railway was built and subsequently its sidings. Almost all the sidings went out of use in the late 1980s and the Site is now largely derelict.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Albion Archaeology has undertaken extensive investigations, overseen by CgMs Consulting on behalf of Southill Estates, in advance of flood compensation measures at Eastcotts to the east of Bedford.  The presence of flint tools and flakes hints at human activity in the late Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age (up to 8000 years ago).  However, the first substantive evidence for activity on the site dates to the early Iron Age (2700 years ago) when a major boundary was constructed.  This was modified in the middle Iron Age and endured, in some form, into the Roman period. Despite the presence of this boundary only limited evidence for middle and late Iron Age activity was identified.  In contrast, the area was intensively occupied in the Roman period (2000 years ago) when there were two settlements (one on each side of the Brook), fields and dispersed activity that included isolated burials.  The settlement to the north of the Brook is interpreted as a planned rural village - a type that is rarely identified in Roman Britain.  The only evidence for post-Roman settlement was an isolated early Saxon building to the south of the Brook.  By the medieval period the area fell within the open field systems of the nearby townships of Harrowden and Cardington.  It is hoped that this project will be written up and publication with that of the Bedford Southern Bypass  </value>

As a result a small area excavation 20 x 20m was undertaken in 2010 prior to development. This revealed two more plough truncated pits, one containing 2 sherds of Bronze Age pottery, the other a single, possibly Bronze Age, flint. An unstratified flint from an engineer's test pit is of probable Neolithic type.

Mesolithic flints were also recovered but no features of that date. The early Neolithic was represented by a single pit containing three pottery bowls in what appears to be a placed deposit. Beaker period pottery accompanied a 'burnt mound'. The Middle Bronze Age saw the site host a small cremation cemetery and numerous non-funerary pits. The Early Iron Age saw an increasing density of features and certainly of pottery use, a small ring ditch and a post-built roundhouse, accompanied by an increase in the digging of pits.  Most of the site's features belong to an early Roman phase of land use, with the ceramics suggesting this occupied a short span for the middle of the 1st to the middle of the 2nd century AD. An extensive, ordered field system was laid out and modified, and while there is little structural evidence to suggest the area within this was inhabited, 20kg of pottery does suggest settlement cannot be far away.   A large medieval boundary ditch (or sequence of ditches) was examined only in enough detail to identify it as such and to ensure its preservation in situ.  </value>

Four areas of 1ha, 0.075ha, 0.3ha, and 0.64ha were subject to archaeological excavation.  In the course of the excavation a large number of archaeological features were uncovered including deposits of Pleistocene date, potentially Mesolithic pits, an enclosure of possible Neolithic date, an Iron Age field system, trackways, a grain dryer, and potentially other hearths or furnaces lying within the vicinity, and a slagpit furnace of Iron Age or early medieval date.  The enclosure was found in association with pit groups containing assemblages of Middle Neolithic and Late Neolithic Grooved Ware pottery; in the case of the latter also with a unique slate disc incised with geometric patterns on both sides. The enclosure itself remains undated at present. The topography of the site is striking.  Undated features likely to be of prehistoric date include a large pit dug over a large natural rock fissure and an extensive series of hearth pits and pits containing burnt material found throughout the site. Several examples of structured deposition of artefacts of prehistoric date were also found within pits.

Four separate areas of strip, map and sample  were excavated on-site, targeted on features identified in a  preceding field evaluation, including a small number of linear  features and prehistoric pits identified in the south-western portion  of the site.  The excavation identified two phases of archaeological  activity, comprising the prehistoric period and the medieval/postmedieval  period. Archaeological features included four  shallow gullies/hedgerows running along north-west to south-east  alignments. A small number of steep-sided  prehistoric pits, the majority of which were sparsely grouped  together at the western edge of Area D with two separate, singular  pits, one of which was located close the south-eastern boundary of  the site and the other situated further to the west on the western  side of the 20th century quarry pits, were also identified during the  excavation. The artefact assemblages from the excavation were  consistent with the results of the previous evaluation, with a small  amount of worked flints recovered mostly from Area D, including a  flint blade from one of the pits on the western part of Area D, and a  small amount prehistoric pottery, and Romano-British pottery. Plant  macrofossils recovered from samples indicate that processing of  cereals, including oats, spelt and emmer wheat and barley, within  the site, consistent with Iron Age/Romano British activity.

Pollen analysis found evidence of a Pine and Hazel dominated habitat giving way deciduous forest species then to grass and sedge fen over time. Furthermore, microscopic charcoal fragments seen in the pollen analysis could be indirect evidence of anthropogenic disturbance.

<value columnNumber="1">Between 29th-31st May 2012 an archaeological trench evaluation was carried on a small building plot (165 sq m) located on the east side of Auckland Road, Cambridge in advance of the construction of the Beth Shalom synagogue and community centre. Beneath a layer of modern building rubble, 19th-century garden soil and re-deposited gravel lay the truncated surface of a complex sequence of early post-medieval backfilled quarry pits and spoil dumps. These probable square and rectangular pits were all different sizes and lay adjacent to one another, some of them slightly intercutting, with others cut from the top of the subsoil or into already quarried ground. In order to best record these the 11m long trench was machined down to the underlying natural (marly gravel) surface into which the bases of a number of round to oval or moon-shaped quarry pits had been cut. None of the coarseware pottery recovered from the pit fills and quarry-spoil dump layers appeared to be later than 16th century AD in date, whilst most of these were of locally-made 15th century types. It seems likely therefore that this area of ground on the edge of the First/Second Gravel Terraces was intensively quarried and re-quarried during the 16th-17th centuries, prior to subsequent re-development. The late medieval (15th-century) pottery found within these quarry fills was probably re-deposited, and therefore reflects the presence of contemporary settlement within this area between Barnwell and the town of Cambridge. Also re-deposited within the quarry waste and soil backfill were a number of Mesolithic-Early Neolithic flint blades and microliths, suggesting the presence of prehistoric flint-working sites along the riverside.         </value>

A deposit containing Mesolithic and possibly Neolithic flints represents the earliest activity on the site (Phase 1). An undated curvilinear ditch (Phase 2) which may originally have been circular in form was identified towards the south-eastern corner of the site. This feature had been cut by a probable Roman period burial (Phase 4), which had in turn been cut by a ditch associated with a probable Roman field system (Phase 6).   Four burial pits have been identified as Iron Age in date (Phase 3), one of which was a stone-lined cist. The pits contained a minimum of six individuals, as two of the graves contained double inhumations.   Six inhumation burials have been identified as Roman (Phase 4). Stratigraphic evidence suggests that they predate the Roman field system (Phase 6) and finds-rich soil deposits (Phase 7). These skeletons had evidence of decapitation. The various cremation deposits and possible pyre site are also likely to be Roman, although again there is no definitive dating evidence at present. A horse burial may be another contemporary deposit, although it could also be Iron Age.  A rampart base may have been part of a Roman military structure (Phase 5). A network of ditches is interpreted as a Roman field system which is likely to be contemporary with the use of Inveresk fort (Phase 6). This was sealed by finds-rich soil deposits (Phase 7) which may be related to the abandonment of the fort, and which contained large quantities of pottery and animal bone.   A later post-built structure (Phase 8) was identified within the rampart.

Sediment recovery was good in the borehole and an intact, stratigraphic sequence was retrieved. Initial assessment of the stratigraphy correlates well with the previous geoarchaeological deposit model and geoarchaeological borehole evaluation at the nearby Shaft F location. It is concluded that given the similarity of the location, levels and stratigraphy of the Shaft G and Shaft F borehole results there is low potential for reconstructing the late prehistoric/historic period from the cores from the Shaft G as well as low potential for surviving evidence of occupation given the seasonal inundation of the site over time.

Two trenches were excavated with a cumulative length of 15m. Colluvial deposits between 800mm and 1200mm deep were recorded in both trenches, and found to contain significant levels of worked prehistoric flint, predominantly dating to the Bronze Age. No cut features were identified within the upper levels of colluvium, however in Trench A, a possible lynchet deposit and ditch were revealed from c.860mm below the ground surface, which corresponded to the alignment of a shallow upstanding topographic anomaly.   The lynchet and ditch both survived below the proposed formation depth of the development. Nonetheless, a watching brief was recommended both to monitor for archaeological features within the colluvium, and to obtain a controlled sample of cultural material from within it.   Subsequent to the evaluation, a watching brief was undertaken during the initial excavation of the reed bed, during which a sample of the colluvium was sieved to enhance the retrieval of cultural artefacts. This revealed the remains of a 17th to 18th century wall, and some small cut features which are likely to be relatively recent in date.  The artefacts recovered during the work suggest that there has been activity in the area from at least the Mesolithic period, and large quantities of artefacts have accumulated against the lynchet from the Bronze Age through to the medieval period, suggesting that there was activity further upslope throughout these periods.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeological Excavations were carried out at Loughborough Road Asfordby, Leics. (SK 701 192). Archaeological excavations and a watching brief were carried out on a prehistoric site between January and September 2009 by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) in advance of development by and on behalf of Jelson Homes Ltd. Excavations revealed features of Mesolithic, Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age and Iron Age date, including a cremation burial, pits, gullies, postholes, and reuse of treethrow features. The Mesolithic component of site included an in situ scatter of probable 'middle' Mesolithic date, and was joint funded by Jelson Ltd and English Heritage. The site archive will be held with Leicestershire Museums, under the accession number XA124 2008.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A Community Archaeology project was organised under the auspices of Archaeology South-East (ASE), a division of University College London Centre for Applied Archaeology (UCLCAA). The current report provides the results of the second season of archaeological investigation of a 3.7ha field called Little Stiances, located at Sharpsbridge Lane, Newick, East Sussex. This work was carried out in June 2013.    Geophysical and topographic surveys carried out in 2010 confirmed the location of a 'lost' cottage known from cartographic sources and allowed the targeting of test-pits at that location both in 2010 and during the second season of investigation in 2013. This year the 'Cottage Site' again produced a range of finds reflecting the occupation of buildings in that part of the field mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Finds ranged from pottery, glass and clay pipes to the bricks and tiles from demolished building(s), to more 'personal' artefacts such as the remains of a knife, a fork and a number of decorated buttons. Some of the character of the interior of the building(s) is shown by the survival of door fittings, and part of a decorative metal plate, probably from the cooking range. Peculiarly the excavation this year also yielded metalwork elements from a number of different sizes of shoe, and the remains of part of a leather boot, complete with brass eyelets.    Investigation of a smaller 'House Platform' adjacent to a sunken lane (both identified during the topographical survey in 2010) uncovered evidence of medieval activity represented by a small assemblage of 13th to 15th century pottery. Discovery of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork highlights the use of the general area by Hunter/Gatherers stretching the site's chronology back into prehistory.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeology South East was commissioned by 4 Delivery Ltd to undertake an Archaeological Watching Brief at Chillerton water Works Chillerton, Isle of Wight, during re-furbishment of the water treatment plant at this site. The project included both archaeological and geo-archaeological observations, the latter producing a stand-alone annexe within the full report.    No evidence of in situ occupation was identified for any period. Finds were retrieved from the topsoil and upper horizon of colluvium to the west of the site. Nine pieces of Mesolithic and early Neolithic struck flint were retrieved from this re-deposited context. A single flint core is characteristic of the pyramidal cores carried by Mesolithic hunter gatherers. A small quantity of abraded pottery from the 12th-14th centuries and the 17th-18th centuries is indicative of manuring of the agricultural soil during these periods.    The geological sequence underlying topsoil is characterised by Holocene colluvium overlying material which has undergone downslope mass movement, possibly Pleistocene or early Holocene in date, over fluvial gravel of the same period. The underlying substrate is Gault Clay.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">John Moore Heritage Services carried out an evaluation at land west of 7 Oday Hill, Drayton, Oxfordshire (NGR SU 4856 9512). The site is located within an area of considerable archaeological potential; on the south west corner of the proposed development is a circular feature, identified as a cropmark ring ditch. The eastern edge of this ring ditch was identified within the trench and sample excavated. Where excavated the form and depth of the ditch indicates that the feature is likely to be a round barrow rather than the ring ditch of a round house. The evaluation also identified a series of archaeological features extending to the east of the barrow. These included post holes, pits and ditches from which a number of artefacts were recovered, including pottery, flint and animal bone. One sherd of pottery was dated to the Late Iron Age while one flint flake was of possible Mesolithic or Late Neolithic date. The remains encountered therefore appear to represent activity dating from the Mesolithic or Neolithic, the Bronze Age and also the Iron Age.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A watching brief carried out during construction works at Fallago Rig Wind Farm identified six pits and a possible trackway. The features were uncovered across the site with the pits forming a cluster of three, two and a single pit on south facing slopes. The pits were charcoal-rich and contained fire cracked stones implying that they were fire pits. The charred wood recovered during sample processing consisted of birch and oak. Radiocarbon dates obtained from birch roundwood charcoal from one of the pits indicates a Mesolithic date (6427-6253 and 6229-6082 cal BC).   The discovery of a pit which is potentially Mesolithic in date is significant as it adds to a small but ever increasing list of Mesolithic domestic settlement sites in Scotland. Typically, Mesolithic settlement sites are very ephemeral in nature and are largely comprised of a variety of post-hole and stake-hole settings, hearths, depressions, and other slight traces inferred from charcoal and artefact spreads. Fallago Rig is perhaps another example of a site of this nature, with the fire-pit suggesting at least short term occupation. However, it cannot be presumed that all of the pits are of the same date or function.</value>

There has been little detailed archaeological investigation in the area surrounding the site, although struck flints dating from the Mesolithic through to the Bronze Age have been recovered. Although a Roman road runs close to the site and a possibly Saxon lane demarcates the eastern boundary, little activity from these periods has been recorded in the area. Medieval settlement in the area is known from the Domesday Survey.     The site has been evaluated (trial trenched) including a geo-archaeological assessment (Doyle and Hallybone 2006; Bates 2006).    The excavation of Area G1 revealed no archaeological features excepting a modern land drain and former field boundary.  Two struck flint were found  </value>

A likely deep west-east aligned palaeochannel  was recorded on the northern part of the site. Two boreholes were collected and assessed. This revealed peat deposits ranging in age from at least the early Mesolithic to late Neolithic / early Bronze Age. A palaeobotanical assessment (pollen, seeds, wood and diatoms) has demonstrated the potential for: reconstructing the former environment, including evidence of changes in vegetation, natural / anthropogenic impact and changes in relative sea level rise.

Twenty-eight of these were investigated and excavated, therefore preserving thirty sites in situ.    The majority of the features recorded and/or excavated are likely to relate to post-medieval use of the landscape for agricultural and industrial purposes. However, a number of lithic finds suggest earlier prehistoric activity across the site, dating from the Late Mesolithic to the Neolithic or Early Bronze Age. The most significant find was a small lithic scatter on Spur 8 dating to the Late Mesolithic. The lithic scatter is of a small size and extent and it most likely represents a few stops to make new tools or re-sharpen, maintain or use existing tools.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological investigation was carried out by Southampton City Council Archaeology Unit for Halcrow Group Limited on behalf of Scotia Gas Networks at Lepe, prior to the laying of the Cross-Solent gas pipeline. This covered the areas to be used as a site compound, a drill site, the 3km long pipe-stringing area and associated works. Twenty-two areas were stripped. Most contained no archaeological features or only post-medieval ditches. A number of flints were recovered including a Mesolithic core and later prehistoric pieces.    One trench, T11, produced a complex area of Romano-British activity including ditches, pits, kilns/hearths and structural features. This area was subject to further work to retrieve dating and environmental evidence. This revealed some evidence of 1st and 2nd century activity but the main phases of occupation dated to the 3rd and 4th centuries, when a rectilinear field system, aligned on the nearby Roman road, was laid out across the landscape, followed by the production of grog-tempered pottery in a number of small stone-built kilns.     Air photos and previously discovered finds suggest this newly discovered settlement covered an area some 300m square straddling the narrow strip of land along which Roman Road Margary 423 passed to reach the coast of the Solent less than 1km to the south. The settlement undoubtedly formed an important node between land and sea trade in the Roman period and will merit further research.  </value>

The site is located within the centre of Long Melford, flanked by the medieval High Street to the west and by the school and a modern housing estate to the north, east and south.     Small quantities of residual Mesolithic to Early Bronze Age flint were recovered from the site, with further redeposited Iron Age struck flint and pottery present within later feature fills. The main phase of occupation dates from the later Iron Age-Roman transition into the 2nd century AD. This consisted of a small number of pits, aligned ditches and postholes, which produced early Roman pottery, animal bone, CBM, metal working debris and a possibly associated crucible, burnt flint, lava quern, fired clay and iron nails.     The more unusual features on site were a cremation burial and three grave cuts, containing the remains of four individuals, dating from the late 1st to late 2nd centuries. The cremation contained an adult with an urn and three vessels. The latest grave produced two samian dishes and a flagon and also contained a skull fragment of a child alongside the adult female buried therein. Another of the graves, for an adult man produced a single jar and the presence of nails formed clear evidence for a coffin. These two inhumations were also buried within rectangular cuts, far larger than required for a coffin. The final grave only contained the partial remains of an adult.</value>

During this time, an impressive prehistoric monument complex was uncovered, comprising three Neolithic cursuses and a complete Late Neolithic hengiform. This ceremonial activity is bracketed by earlier in situ Upper Palaeolithic and Late Mesolithic flint scatters found in association with preserved buried soil horizons, and later Bronze Age occupation, consisting of coaxial field system ditches, a partial ring gully, burnt stone pits and isolated cremation deposits. Two Roman trackways and several probable Roman quarry pits and ditches were also revealed. Beneath the alluvial overburden, substantial networks of braided palaeochannel systems had carved the gravel terraces into 'islands', across which the prehistoric activity was located. The Roman features were cut from within the alluvial overburden, whilst post-Medieval trackways were recorded in the uppermost alluvial and topsoil layers.  </value>

Geoarchaeological and geotechnical deposit data can be used to identify areas of archaeological potential by characterising the probable nature and depth of sub-surface deposits.    The bedrock is Thanet Sand a stiff fine grained, greenish unit, representing a shallow marine deposit of the mid-Thanetian. It was only recorded in one location on site at -4.21m OD, due to the poor retrieval of sediments at depth. The lower alluvium, a pale blue silty clay was recovered below c. -2.97m OD, again in only one location on site. This unit may be related to low-lying peri-marine/ estuarine clays found elsewhere in the Wantsum Channel. Running sands were encountered from c. 0m OD downwards and are thought to be Mesolithic peri-marine to fluvial sands, although recovery of this unit was particularly bad. No organic deposits are recorded on the site. Upper alluvium in the form of variable clays, silts and sands; greenish yellow to blue grey in colour; were recorded from c. 3.37 down to -0.49m OD and likely represent further (late prehistoric to historic) mudflats and saltmarsh expansion.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The 2014 excavation follows on from various earlier archaeological work done on the quarry, the most recent in 2013. It provides a fitting conclusion to what amounts to an exploration of the development of a landscape from the Mesolithic era to the Medieval period. No similar area has previously been explored in this way and represents an expansion of knowledge of regional if not national importance. A Bronze Age cremation deposit and a non-domestic post-hole building are of interest. The medieval evidence from North Park Farm Quarry forms an unusually complete picture of the functioning of a landscape in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its regularity suggests a carefully planned development and its demise was the consequence of a fundamental reorganisation of the local economy, itself part of a dramatic shift in the regional organisation of the landscape in the century or so between 1150 and 1250. The detail and relative completeness (especially of the evidence from the quarry) with which this development can be demonstrated at Bletchingley make it the best example of this change, and of very great importance.</value>

Bronze Age flints were also retreived from this layer.  The earliest feature on the site was a large boundary ditch, in the south western corner, possibly of late Iron Age origin.  It was recut soon after the Roman occupation.  A rubbish pit containing an articulated burial of a young adult female dating to the 2nd century AD.was also recorded in the south western corner of the site.  In the north eastern corner a possible 2nd century AD SFB was recorded.  Nine burnt pits, with Archeomagnetic dates to the late 5th-early 6th century were recorded across the site.

The project is led by the Cambridge Archaeological Unit and the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cardiff. Geophysical survey over the extraction area identified a large rectilinear enclosure, co-axial ditch system, areas of pitting and two circular anomalies, all confirmed during evaluation to be prehistoric in date. In 2011 the first phase of open area excavation targeted two swathes over the extraction area (Areas 1 and 4). This exposed features and deposits of Bronze Age to Medieval date, with surface (sub-soil) finds covering all periods from the later Mesolithic to the present. Main features include: Coaxial field system (Bronze Age or Early Iron Age?), including a fragmented stone macehead; a penannular gulley (diam. 12m), 66 pits (with two main clusters), part of the rectilinear enclosure with a southwest entrance, and various associated ditches forming a 'way' (Mid-Late Iron Age). Associated finds include 3 articulated or partially articulated skeletons in the enclosure ditch; 155 items of metalwork, with two coin silver staters, a lump of gold, an iron currency bar, tyre, latch lifter, bridle bit, spearhead, socketed knife and toothed saw; worked bone including a knife handle and cheekpiece; Glastonbury Ware pottery.

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of a programme of archaeological excavations and watching brief carried out by Archaeology South-East (ASE) on land at 'Wickhurst Green', Broadbridge Heath, West Sussex between June 2008 and May 2013. The archaeological investigations were required to mitigate the archaeological impact of a large residential development and in order to discharge an associated planning condition. The fieldwork was commissioned by RPS on behalf of their clients Countryside Properties.     The excavations represent perhaps the largest single archaeological investigation conducted within the Weald of West Sussex, an area which has suffered from a historical lack of fieldwork. The site succeeded in exposing multi-period remains dating from the Mesolithic to the post-medieval period of a density that was perhaps un-expected.    The location of the site on gently sloping land close to the River Arun was possibly attractive to ancient settlement and land-use. Together with other recent fieldwork in the wider area the results indicate that Wealden sites close to water courses should   no longer be considered of low archaeological potential. The results present the possibility of examining multi-period archaeological activity on a landscape scale.    The report is written and structured so as to conform to the standards required of post-excavation analysis work as set out in Management of Archaeological Projects (English Heritage 1991). Preliminary  analysis of the stratigraphic, finds and environmental material has indicated a provisional chronology, and allowed assessments of the potential of the site archive to address the original research agenda, as well as assessing the significance of the findings. This has highlighted what further analysis work is required in order to enable suitable dissemination of the findings in a final publication.  </value>

The route corridor was 21km long, and located on the Hoo Peninsula, linking Shorne in the west, with the Isle of Grain in the east. A total of 67 evaluation trenches, 13 contingency trenches, 15 test pits and 34 Palaeoenvironmental test pits (reported on separately) were excavated, all within a 36m wide pipeline easement. Archaeological deposits were recorded along much of the pipeline route, and although heavily truncated in many places, were often exposed between 300mm and 500mm below the ground surface. Furthermore, a number of discrete archaeologically sensitive areas were revealed, including evidence for Neolithic/Mesolithic, Late Bronze Age, Romano-British, Iron Age, and Anglo-Saxon activity. Most notably a Romano-British industrial site with a probable pottery kiln was recorded, as well as a Late Bronze Age settlement, or possibly funerary site, and what may have been a small scale industrial site, also belonging to the Late Bronze Age.  The results of the evaluation have been used in conjunction with proceeding stage 1 archaeological research (Field Walking and Geophysical Surveys and a Desk Based Assessment), to highlight those areas with the highest potential for significant surviving archaeological deposits. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd submitted a proposal to develop a large area of semi-rural land on the south-eastern fringe of Rochdale, Greater Manchester (SD 9180 1200). The development proposal allows for the construction of a new industrial estate, and necessitates the destruction of rural dwellings and other relict landscape features, some which date to the 17th century and earlier. An archaeological condition was attached to the planning consent, and a brief detailing the required archaeological works was devised by the Assistant County Archaeologist for Greater Manchester. In the first instance, a desk-based assessment of the development area was undertaken, which identified several sites of historical and archaeological interest; followed by a programme of building survey. Targeted archaeological evaluation, coupled with limited photographic, topographic, and palaeoenvironmental survey, which was undertaken by Oxford Archaeology North (OA North). The results of the evaluation led to the detailed excavation of ten post-medieval farmsteads by OA North, a watching brief, and a programme of targeted palaeoenvironmental assessment. Palaeoenvironmental data recovered from the site has potential to provide an excellent record of vegetation change in relation to anthropogenic activity between the Mesolithic and Bronze Age periods. The development of this area since the medieval period is represented by a diverse range of landscape features, including ridge and furrow cultivation, routeways and farmsteads. The results obtained from the excavation of ten post-medieval farmsteads provide a rare opportunity to examine the development of such structures. Several distinct types of farm buildings have been recognised, including laithe-houses, L-shaped and combination layouts, together with purpose-built weavers' cottages and a labourer's tenement.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The evaluation yielded interesting results relating to the sequence of deposition on the River Box flood plain in the early Holocene period. The changing nature of the landscape and local environment during the transition from the middle Mesolithic to early Neolithic periods has been established to a reasonable degree of certainty, based on comparison models.     C14 dating of material contained within the above stratigraphic sequence produced anomalous results compared with the initial assessment. This is a documented problem with fluvial flood plain environments in parts of East Anglia due to complex floral and faunal composition and activity (see Suffolk River Valleys Project, 2006). The C14 dates were also not consistent with the 'a priori' established deposition of material in the stratigraphic sequence and therefore cannot be relied upon as accurate. The late Neolithic date returned by both samples suggests some contamination either in this period or an addition of carbon contamination later that topped up the existing carbon.    No finds or features were identified during the evaluation; however the evidence of middle Mesolithic to early Neolithic environment and landscape identified in the initial pollen analysis represents a rare and valuable opportunity to examine the changes in vegetation and landscape that occurred in the early-temperate part of the Holocene in this part of Suffolk.  </value>

A rectilinear enclosure was also recorded close to an area of pitting, probably for quarrying and for storage.    The main focus of the Bronze Age activity was in the east of the site where a number of post built structures were recorded, while some of these appear to have been used for cereal storage and processing others are may have ritual functions given the presence of three barrows on site.    While the Iron Age saw less activity on site, what there was appeared to respect much of the Bronze Age landscape; similarly aligned features and continuation of pitting were present in some areas.     The prehistoric activity as a whole also highlighted the frequent mirroring of the alignment of the Roman road Stane Street, with both Bronze Age and Iron Age features on this alignment or perpendicular to it suggesting the road may follow the line of an older trackway.    The Roman period saw surprisingly little activity given the proximity of the road; only a few sherds of pottery from a colluvial deposit were retrieved. The colluvium appears to have been deposited in two main phases with all features cut through the lower colluvium while the upper deposit overlay the Bronze Age and Iron Age features and may be of Roman date.

A Mesolithic worked flint and a few sherds of earlier Neolithic and later Neolithic / earlier Bronze Age pottery (most of which were residual finds in later contexts) suggested transitory use of the site in those periods.    The earliest evidence for settled occupation of the site dated to the later Bronze Age and was represented by the remains of two roundhouses, several square or rectangular buildings or structures, pits, postholes and external hearth deposits. The settlement was apparently unenclosed; an undated ditched track or drove-way to the north of the main area of occupation might have defined the limit of the settlement at one time. It is likely that the settlement extended beyond the area of excavation to the west.    Artefactual and environmental evidence suggests that this was a purely domestic site; there is no conclusive evidence for industrial activity. Cereal crops were used, but it would appear that these were not processed on site. The large later Bronze Age pottery assemblage is of regional significance.    The settlement was abandoned during the later Bronze Age and buried by wind-blown sand. A ditched track that truncated one of the roundhouses is not dated conclusively but might have been the continuation of a Roman track found previously to the east of this site.    There is no conclusive evidence for the use of the site in the medieval period, although a possible hollow way might have formed at that time.

The archaeological works revealed evidence for pre-oppidum activity in the form of two clusters of later Prehistoric pits, which were associated with burnt flints; a possible small pit, which was provisionally dated to the Bronze Age; and a moderately sized assemblage of flints, which ranged in date from the Mesolithic to the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age periods.  The excavation has demonstrated that the previously suggested layout of the Late Iron Age - early Roman entrance through the Wheeler Ditch was probably incorrect or incomplete and has provided data to allow a new entrance layout to be postulated.  The current project also identified the presence of a small Late Iron Age or early Roman cremation cemetery at the location of the postulated entrance, along with a hollow, which contained a cobbled surface, immediately to the east of the postulated entrance.  Stratigraphic and artefacual evidence, which included a substantial pottery assemblage as well as a coin hoard, indicated that the Wheeler Ditch, near to the postulated entrance, was likely to have been in-filled in the earlier Roman period and was, subsequently, re-cut in the later Roman or, possibly sub-Roman or early Saxon periods.

Trenches 5, 6 and 7 represented the most archaeological dense areas of the site with several large linear ditches and pits revealed during the evaluation and containing material culture from the Roman and Medieval  period and serval pieces of worked flint, residual deposits dated from the Mesolithic and early Neolithic period. Trenches 4 and 9 did not reveal any deposits or artefacts of archaeological interest suggesting the limit of archaeological potential lays to the north and northeast of the proposed site.  The trenching revealed a site of high archaeological potential with the archaeological remains indicated a multiple phase occupation extending from the roman period to the medieval. The proposed development would have a high impact upon the archaeological potential of the site and thus a suitable mitigation strategy would have to be developed.      </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Headland Archaeology conducted an archaeological excavation on land at Whinny Hill, Rosyth following an evaluation by trial trenching.  The site (Land Parcel 1) is part of the Forth Replacement Crossing and was excavated in advance of the proposed commencement of construction works.  The evaluation had identified archaeological features in five areas across the site.  Five trenches (A to E) were subsequently excavated.  Trench C revealed a possible ditch to be part of a natural depression filled with sandy silt, while Trench D contained a large pit, as recorded during the evaluation,  but no further features.  Trench E contained modern drainage features.  Trench B contained a number of features, including a possible structure and worked chert and quartz was recovered from three features.  The excavation area was subsequently extended to encompass Trench A and to reveal the extent of the spread of features.  The excavation area contained two possible structures and over 60 other features including hearths, gullies and large pits. Worked chert and quartz and knapping debris found across the site demonstrate the use of Mesolithic technology in the manufacture of stone tools. The site itself is comparable to that at Echline Fields (Land Parcel 4 - excavated as part of the same contract) on the opposite side of the Forth, which revealed the site of a possible house as well as evidence for Mesolithic technology. Prehistoric sea level changes demonstrate the site would have lain close to the water's edge during the Mesolithic and may represent a seasonal or temporary camp.   </value>

These two areas incorporated the archaeological features revealed in the previous evaluation works undertaken in 2010.    The additional works revealed a further 31 archaeological features. These were largely isolated pits and post-holes of probable prehistoric date. The pits included fire-pits and stone filled examples. A single structure was identified in the form of a large pit with an associated supers-structure of six surrounding post-holes. Lithics and decorated pottery sherds of probable Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age date were recovered from the structure. Two linear boundary ditch remnants were also identified.

Environmental analysis of the channel deposits indicates the local environment consisted of wetland or marsh, with adjacent non-waterlogged disturbed ground. The channel contained small assemblages of artefacts dating from the Late Mesolithic to the Early to Middle Iron Age, indicating it was open and receiving material for a considerable length of time. The evaluation also identified a spread of calcined flint, mixed in a 'greasy' charcoal rich sandy matrix, located adjacent to the palaeochannel in the north-eastern corner of the site. Although this feature was not fully defined in the trench and had been affected by later activity, it is plausible that it represents the partial remains of a 'Burnt Mound', a type of (commonly Bronze Age) monument commonly found adjacent to water sources/ in wetland environments.

Accordingly, a four-trench evaluation was undertaken by Archaeological Research and Consultancy of the University of Sheffield (ARCUS) in 2004. This encountered the putative remains of a roundhouse gully and several lithic artefacts in Evaluation Trench 2, located within the north-eastern corner of the proposed development site. Subsequently, PDNPA issued a brief for an excavation on the site. Oxford Archaeology North (OA North) produced a project design to meet this brief and, following its approval, were commissioned to undertake the work by John Samuels Archaeological Consultants (JSAC), on behalf of MHA.  OA North undertook the fieldwork in October 2005, which comprised the re-excavation and extension of Evaluation Trench 2. A moderate assemblage of Mesolithic and Neolithic stone artefacts was recovered from the topsoil, subsoil and a deposit later identified as colluvium; however, as these artefacts were redeposited and not recovered from stratified archaeological contexts, they have very limited potential for further analysis. Once the excavation reached the natural drift geology, the putative roundhouse gully and a number of similar features were found and identified as shale-filled variations in the natural geology.   </value>

The assessment was commissioned by Shanly Homes Ltd in support of proposals to redevelop the site to include five new dwellings and maintain two retail units.  The assessment site is located on the High Street, one of the principal thoroughfares of the medieval and post-medieval historic core of the town.  The latter is defined by a grid layout of burgage plots.  Prior to the development of the medieval town only sparse prehistoric archaeology has been recorded, including Mesolithic flint found opposite the site.  A Roman road and river crossing have been postulated in association with the High Street.  A riverside settlement developed at Marlow in the late Saxon period, and excavations have produced 10th-11th century pottery that suggests the High Street may have been established in this period.  In the medieval period burgage plots were laid out perpendicular to the High Street, with the modern site continuing to occupy one of these plots.  The full extent of this early urban plan and the character of individual plots remain conjectured, in part based on excavated evidence from other High Street plots, therefore the site has a high potential to further address the characterisation of the development of Marlow.  Early cartographic sources indicate a building occupied the site for at least part of the post-medieval period, before the existing Grade II Listed street frontage building was built in the early 19th century.

The boreholes were drilled with a terrier rig to the surface of the Pleistocene sand and gravel in order to recover Holocene floodplain deposits seen in the watching brief. Unfortunately the sample recovery was limited to one borehole (BHR2) because of the intransigence and extent of the modern made ground and historic backfilling deposits at other locations. However, the assessment carried out on the borehole sample provided a record of landscape change particularly through the late Neolithic and Bronze Age periods when a marsh developed over the gravel floodplain which had remained high and dry throughout the Mesolithic. Although no direct evidence was found on the site of human occupation, there was much indirect evidence particularly through pollen assessment of agricultural activity locally during this period probably on the higher terrace to the north of the site. </value>

The evaluation confirmed the results of the geophysical survey in that the several ditches were located and very few discrete features (post holes and pits) were present.  The lack of finds from the features, within the exception of a flint flake, coupled with the presence of prehistoric flintwork and pottery from the topsoil suggests that the field boundaries are prehistoric.  A rectangular enclosure may be of the same date. Where dateable, the finds seem to indicate an early Bronze Age date for the activity.    A chert blade core is of Mesolithic or Neolithic date.

The sparse distribution of struck flint is reflected by the trial trench evaluation, but the  geophysical anomalies identified during the geophysical survey were not substantially  apparent during the trial trenching, although Areas 1 and 2 did contain a few  archaeological features. Trial trenching suggested that the focus of archaeological  features was in the north-western sector of the site. Isolated trenches also contained  archaeological features. Sparse residual Mesolithic/Neolithic struck flint was recovered  from the excavated features, but the earliest cut feature was an early Iron Age hearth  (F1036 Trench 50). Although some undated features may belong to this early phase, the  majority of features were mid to late Iron Age/early Romano-British linear ditches on  NE/SW axes, perhaps co-axial to the course of the river Cam/Granta to the west; discrete  pits and postholes were also recorded. Although no structural evidence was recorded in  the evaluation, finds and environmental assemblages suggests a settlement within or in  the immediate vicinity of the site.  Some features contained Late Iron Age pottery which may extend into the early Roman  period. The question of continuity from the late Iron Age to the Romano-British period is  one of considerable importance, as the evaluation has identified an Iron Age precursor to  previously-identified local Roman occupation.  </value>

The Late Bronze Age saw a dramatic increase in activity on site intense activity taking place in isolated pockets of the site as well as the digging of large linears again isolated from other features. A rectilinear enclosure was also recorded close to an area of pitting, probably for quarrying and for storage.    The main focus of the Bronze Age activity was in the east of the site where a number of post built structures were recorded, while some of these appear to have been used for cereal storage and processing others are may have ritual functions given the presence of three barrows on site.    While the Iron Age saw less activity on site, what there was appeared to respect much of the Bronze Age landscape; similarly aligned features and continuation of pitting were present in some areas.     The prehistoric activity as a whole also highlighted the frequent mirroring of the alignment of the Roman road Stane Street, with both Bronze Age and Iron Age features on this alignment or perpendicular to it suggesting the road may follow the line of an older trackway.    The Roman period saw surprisingly little activity given the proximity of the road; only a few sherds of pottery from a colluvial deposit were retrieved. The colluvium appears to have been deposited in two main phases with all features cut through the lower colluvium while the upper deposit overlay the Bronze Age and Iron Age features and may be of Roman date.

The wider area has also been a site of occupation activity since the Mesolithic period with significant settlement activity identified in the Roman, Saxon, medieval and post-medieval periods. The assessment site is situated at least 500m from the focus of much of this settlement activity, and a moderate potential for Bronze Age, Roman and medieval remains is suggested.    The potential for all other periods is considered to be low and the historic maps show the site probably remained in agricultural use until the mid-19th century when quarrying first appears on the historic maps, evidence of this quarrying activity has also been identified by the aerial photography and LiDAR data.      Two cartographic sources suggest the presence of an 'Old Church Yard' in the north-eastern corner of the site in 1836 and later sources show extensive damage to the centre of the site from levelling and farm building construction. The potential for later post-medieval and modern remains is therefore high.

The work was conducted by Oxford Archaeology North (OA North) on behalf of the Friends of the Lake District. The aim of the work was to provide archaeological information for the management of the landscape and the archaeological resource of the common. The programme of work involved a detailed assessment of documentary sources relating to the area of the common and an identification survey of the whole extent of the estate.   The study area is centred on the traditional boundaries of the common of Little Asby, which has a wealth of archaeological remains of all periods, demonstrating the continued use of this upland area from prehistoric times onwards. There is a significant resource of prehistoric archaeological sites, ranging from lithic findspots that date back to the Mesolithic period, to a small cairnfield and associated field system, which includes a putative Bronze Age round cairn.   Scattered across the area are some small field systems and stock pounds associated with rectilinear settlements; these typically take advantage of sheltered grassy areas amongst the limestone pavement. It is possible that these reflect a low intensity occupation of the marginal lands, probably during the medieval period, and for the most part were apparently a product of transhumant practice (shielings); however, in some localised areas there is the possibility that there was more permanently established settlement. There are also extensive scattered pastoral structures, such as bields and isolated stock pounds; these stock management features appear to be a product of mainly post-medieval upland grazing.   </value>

The islands were delineated by the -0.50m Ordinance Datum (OD) contour and reached a maximum of 0.30m above OD. A buried soil horizon survived across most of the island tops although in places it had been 'replaced' by metalled surfaces made up of thin layers of compacted gravel.

The evaluation forms the first phase of a wider package of drilling and monitoring of geoarchaeological boreholes across the Littlebrook Power Station site. The centre of the site lies at National Grid reference 556000 176160. The site code is KT-LPS14.    The results of the geoarchaeological borehole evaluation have helped to refine the assessment of the potential of the site. Sediment recovery was good in four of the boreholes and deep, continuous Holocene stratigraphic sequences were retrieved in two. Initial assessment of the stratigraphy indicates the site straddles a deep channel feature which correlates well with other work in the area.      As a consequence, the site has a significant potential to contain information on local and regional environmental change in the Holocene, in terms of vegetation and fauna, climate/sea-level change, and human adaptation and exploitation of wetland environments. Palaeo-environmental assessment of selected samples from the boreholes would provide an outline, in combination with other geoarchaeological investigations in the area, of the changing environment during both the prehistoric and historic periods.  Furthermore, the levels of the early Holocene surface obtained from the boreholes can be added to the modelling of the Mesolithic landscape across the London area, leading to a more accurate mapping of the Thames floodplain.    Additional boreholes are planned for the remaining areas of the site. Once completed, the samples will be reviewed and the boreholes with the highest potential for palaeoenvironmental analysis will be selected for assessment.   </value>

Some post-medieval features (field ditches, a possible track and at least one quarry) were recorded also.    Low levels of activity during earlier prehistoric periods were represented by a small assemblage of worked flints, broadly dated to the Neolithic/Bronze Age although two pieces might have been of Mesolithic or Early Neolithic date. The flints were mostly found residually in later (Iron Age and Roman) features or in topsoil/subsoil deposits.    There was some activity on the site during the earlier Iron Age, demonstrated principally by a single pit and a possibly associated ditch. Activity increased in the Late Iron Age/early Roman period, as shown by pits and other cut features containing significance amounts of unabraded pottery and other domestic refuse. This phase of occupation might have been associated with an extensive enclosure ditch and two or three smaller ditched enclosures.    During the fully-Romanised period an extensive, rectilinear enclosure system developed in the northern part of the site; it is not clear if this replaced or extended the existing Late Iron Age/Roman enclosure(s). Significant amounts of unabraded pottery (mainly of mid/late Roman date) demonstrate nearby occupation, and this is supported by the evidence of pits, at least one inhumation and a horse burial.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between November 2006 and March 2007 the Cambridgeshire County Council Archaeological Field Unit (CAM ARC) carried out an archaeological excavation on the land at New Road, Chatteris. Two areas, covering a total of 0.7ha were opened. Area A was situated to the north of the partition wall that subdivided the development area whilst Area B lay to its south. Evidence for human activity spanning the Mesolithic to Medieval periods was recovered, although features directly associated with settlement appeared to date predominantly to the Iron Age and were concentrated toward the southern end of Area B. These comprised boundary ditches and gullies, pits and a very large number of postholes, some of which were concentrated into clusters that appeared to represent the sites of repeated construction, probably of fairly temporary structures. Three cremations dating to the Middle Bronze Age were recorded in Area A. Two inhumations also recovered from Area A were tentatively dated to the Roman period. A number of sherds of Saxon pottery were recorded across the site but of particular significance was the recovery of a sherd of imported North French Blackware. This was an extremely rare find in the county, with Chatteris being just the third site to produce such material. This pottery is thought to have had strong associations with the wine trade and it may therefore be that during this period Chatteris formed a staging post for travel and trade throughout the region.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report describes the methodology and results of archaeological evaluation undertaken by Tees Archaeology at Goldsborough, North Yorkshire as part of an English Heritage funded partnership project between Tees Archaeology and the North York Moors National Park Authority researching the Mesolithic in north east Yorkshire. The fieldwork comprised geophysical survey undertaken in May 2012, fieldwalking undertaken in September 2012, and shovel pitting and test pitting undertaken in March 2013.  The fieldwork produced a mixed flint assemblage ranging in date from the Mesolithic to later prehistory, in keeping with previous finds from the site. The test pitting demonstrated that whilst the geophysical survey had identified some archaeological features, other anomalies were probably the product of underlying geology. Of the five test pits excavated in 2013, two identified cut features which are undated, whilst a third exposed the remains of a hearth containing Mesolithic or early Neolithic flint within and below it.</value>

Part of TEA 19 lay within the floodplain of the River Great Ouse, such that a different methodology was adopted, involving recording the excavation of 4m square test-pits in the floodplain (excavated to depths of 4m), and an auger survey across the floodplain. Elsewhere, the standard open area excavation methodology was adopted, with additional geoarchaeological work on the palaeochannels.    The excavation identified a series of former palaeochannels and river banks, and a small area of buried soil adjacent to one of the palaeochannel containing prehistoric (Mesolithic and Neolithic) worked flints. There was also an Iron Age rectangular enclosure, and the edge of an area of Roman settlement (continuing from TEA 20) with one burial.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A watching brief was undertaken in 2006 during ground works associated with geotechnical investigations of the BritNed Interconnector UK landfall site on the Isle of Grain, Kent. No pre-modern archaeological features or finds were observed.    Holocene alluvium was found in borehole BH120 below made ground and a section of the core at -24.85 to -25.24mOD was analysed. Pollen evidence indicates oak and hazel woodland and an acorn cup produced a 14C date of 9030-8720 BP (late Mesolithic).  Abundant charcoal suggests human activity or natural fires. Plant and animal remains indicate gradual marine inundation, with brackish intertidal creeks developing.    During cable laying offshore in 2010, the previously unreported wreck of a small wooden vessel in poor condition was encountered at approximate position 450546 E, 5741447 N (UTM Zone 31N). Archaeological evaluation suggests that the unidentified wreck was exposed by sandwave migration after 2008. It probably dates to the late nineteenth or twentieth century and was probably a small fishing or recreational boat or World War II patrol or service boat.    During cable burial operations off the Isle of Grain in 2010, part of a previously unreported wooden wreck was discovered in the cable trench at approximate position 346411 E, 5705324 N (UTM Zone 31N). It was completely buried during a subsequent archaeological diving inspection. Size, extent of survival and function of the unidentified vessel are unknown. The recovery of a cuprous fastening suggests that it is unlikely to predate the early nineteenth century.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeology South-East was commissioned by Bovis Homes to undertake a Stage 1 magnetometer survey and a Stage 2 trial trench evaluation on land north of Arundel Road, Peacehaven, East Sussex. Six archaeological evaluation trenches were excavated.    The magnetometer survey identified quantities of modern disturbance and failed to detect any potential buried archaeology. As a result the evaluation trenches were not targeted on any geophysical anomalies but were spread as evenly across the site as possible.     Undisturbed subsoil was recorded across the site and this yielded a good quantity of worked flint and 1 sherd of prehistoric pottery. A finely made Neolithic polished axe was also recovered. Some prehistoric pottery dating to the Late Neolithic/early Bronze Age or Late Iron Age/Roman and Middle/Late Iron Age period was also recovered from within two pits. The flintwork and pottery is consistent with that across the Peacehaven area. Several probable field boundary ditches of likely prehistoric date were also encountered across the site. The alignment of some of these ditches suggests they may form part of small scale Middle Iron Age field systems identified to the east and west of the site during previous excavations.      The finds recovered suggest that the site was in use in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age and again in the Middle to Late Iron Age. Possible Mesolithic and Middle Neolithic activity is also probable, as is occupation in the Late Iron Age or Roman period. The activity is difficult to classify but may include both agricultural activity as well as activity peripheral to occupation.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">MOLA conducted an archaeological desk-based heritage assessment of land at Fakenham Road, Great Ryburgh, Norfolk. The earliest archaeological evidence found dates from the Mesolithic period. Neolithic flint tools have been found close to the west and north-west of the site. A possible Bronze Age ring ditch has been identified to the north-east and finds dating to the period have been discovered through metal detecting surveys. Iron Age remains including pits and pottery have been found within the area of proposed development through trial trenching. The site lies between two Roman settlements on the south-western banks of the River Wensum. One lies nearby to the north-west of the site and numerous finds including coins have been discovered during a fieldwalking survey. A further Roman settlement lies to the south-east where two enclosures, two kilns and two burials have recently been excavated. A middle Saxon cemetery, drainage ditches, an enclosure, land divisions and a substantial boundary ditch have also recently been discovered to the south-east of the site. Metal finds dating to the period have also been found to the north-west and to the east of the site during metal detecting surveys. The site lies beyond the historic core of Great Ryburgh. The medieval settlement developed around the junction of Fakenham Road and Bridge Road to the west of the River Wensum, flanked by the medieval moated manor of Ryburgh at the northern end and by St Andrew's Church to the south. Cartographic evidence suggests that the site lay to the rear of properties fronting Fakenham Road during the post-medieval period and had remained as undeveloped farmland.</value>

The work produced a small assemblage of unstratified/residual Mesolithic to early Neolithic flintwork. Very dense scatters of flintwork have been reported in the fields to the east and the current work suggests some limited exploitation of the site itself during this period. A single pit appeared to represent a special deposit dating to the latest Bronze Age/earliest Iron Age. This included one pottery vessel apparently deposited largely intact and another in a fragmented but partially-complete state. Given the absence of other settlement evidence, it is suggested that this may have been deposited in an isolated location chosen for its association with a nearby brook. Finally, a narrow medieval ditch was recorded crossing the site on an east-north-east west-south-west orientation. Interestingly this feature seems to be aligned with a trackway which survived in use into the late 20th century, leading to a ford across Pipp Brook. This suggests that the trackway and the crossing may have medieval origins.</value>

The work was commissioned by Transport Scotland, managed and monitored by Jacobs Arup and undertaken in advance of the proposed Forth Replacement Crossing (FRC) construction works. Four areas of excavation with a total area of 16032m2 were opened located around features of archaeological interest identified during the evaluation phase.    The majority of the excavated remains relate to Mesolithic occupation of the site with the most significant find being of a sunken-floored structure, measuring 6.96m by 5.92m with a west-facing entrance. Around the edge of the structure were nine post-holes forming an oval that represent the main structural element of the house. A possible inner post ring was identified and this may also be part of the structure of the house. Internally the structure had a cobbled surface to the south alongside a number of hearths and pits. A second possible Mesolithic structure comprised of an oval-shaped arrangement of posts with associated hearths. Alongside these two structures were numerous pits many of which are currently undated.     While the only definite evidence of later activity were two pits containing prehistoric  pottery, including Neolithic Grooved Ware, a structure consisting of a series of intercutting curvilinear ditches appears to date to the Neolithic, indicated by the presence of naked barley. Many features are currently undated and these include a heavily truncated roundhouse. Medieval activity comprised a large pit, dating from the 13th to 14th centuries.

This investigation has succeeded in identifying archaeological features in 23 of the 29 excavated trenches. A very small quantity of residual struck flint artefacts suggests some activity of Mesolithic to Early Neolithic date in the vicinity of the site.

However, much of the archaeological activity recorded remained undated, and comprised pits, ditches, gullies and a single posthole.

The deposits within a possible palaeochannel, identified running roughly east to west across the site demonstrated a good survival of waterlogged material and has a high potential to yield palaeoenvironmental remains.

The earliest phase 1 included natural deposits, starting from London Clay overlaid by sands, overlaid by silty clays and organic deposits. A number of natural channels were also recorded cutting through London Clay and through gravels and sands above it on different levels. The silty clays and organic deposits were dated as early as 11,750 cal BP and 11,410 cal BP.The top of the natural varied between 1.77 m OD in the eyot area in the north-eastern part of the site and -0.94 m OD in the south-western extent, where thick organic deposits had been identified.Phase 2 was illustrated by a number of archaeological features associated with the first, prehistoric human activity identified on the site, potentially corresponding with the Mesolithic period at earliest. These included: patches of in situ burning representing camp fires, possible fish trap comprising stake alignments and possible wattle as well as several pits. This phase was further attested to by a number of struck flint examples, though none found in situ, and occasional burnt animal bone fragments associated with the camp fires. Post-prehistoric phase 3 marked a transition from prehistoric to historic times, signalled by accumulation of waterlain deposits (predominantly silty clays) above the features of the preceding phase 2. A limited number of natural and anthropogenic features were recorded such as silted-up hollows, root-holes, pits and channels - some of which produced examples of redeposited .prehistoric flint. During the final post-medieval phase 4 the site was developed for the first time - which reflects the general urbanisation and industrialisation of the area observed from the 17th century onwards. This phase is illustrated primarily by a number of circular water wells recorded across the site, followed by pits of undetermined function, wall foundations, and finally one example of timber - all dated between 18/19th century.</value>

The evaluation was undertaken on behalf of Worcestershire County Council in support of an Environmental Assessment to be prepared for a planning application seeking to construct a Park and Ride terminal. The evaluation identified a previously unknown prehistoric site that is thought to be potentially Mesolithic in date. The site survives only as a dispersed spread of flint artefacts and fire-cracked stones in the topsoil and subsoil of the field with ploughing having destroyed any archaeological features, which may once have been present. The most diagnostic artefacts included a fragment of an unusual tranchet axe and a microlith, both of which are Mesolithic in date. No features of any period were identified in the sample trenches and the cropmark on an aerial photograph that was thought to be a park boundary now appears to be due to a natural feature.     An archaeological evaluation was also undertaken at Worcester Park and Ride East (balancing pond) (SO 8720 5320; WCM 101274) - an intended expansion to the existing proposed development to incorporate a balancing pond. The evaluation identified a single prehistoric feature comprising a shallow field boundary, which can be tentatively dated to the Neolithic or Bronze Age. The feature provides an indication of early prehistoric activity on the site in the form of agricultural land use. In addition to the feature a single Early Neolithic or Mesolithic flint tool was recovered from an un-stratified context at the south-west end of the site; reflecting the results of previous investigations carried out on Site J.

The survey was commissioned by Jelson Ltd. in advance of the proposed development of the land for new housing and the work took place in October 2014.  A significant assemblage of 74 worked flints was recovered during the survey, which included 40 tools, including an unusual scale-flaked knife, a number of cores, scrapers, and piercers. The remainder of the assemblage was made up of flakes, some of which were retouched. The assemblage is believed to date from the Early Bronze Age but contains a number of re-used pieces from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. The location of the finds suggests that they are associated with two ring ditches within the field, which were originally seen as cropmarks on aerial photographs and have been confirmed by a recent geophysical survey, carried out as part of the current evaluation. The flint assemblage supports the interpretation of these features as Neolithic/Bronze Age burial mounds, which have been ploughed out.   A low density scatter of medieval and early post-medieval pottery was also recovered across the area that was surveyed. A slightly higher concentration of late post-medieval and modern pottery was also present, which has been discarded after examination and logging.

<value columnNumber="1">The results of the three evaluation boreholes when used to update previous deposit modelling broadly confirm anticipated findings. High areas of Pleistocene gravels and early Holocene sand form dry land islands with a low lying channel floodplain. These dry island areas have the potential for Mesolithic activity. Channel routes migrated and silted up in these deeper channel areas during the early Holocene. Subsequently, river levels continued to rise over the Late Mesolithic to Bronze Age, resulting in transgression and regression episodes, which waterlogged these drier island areas allowing for dense wetland vegetation to develop. As further inundation occurred, thick clay alluvial deposits formed, levelling out the terrain, with any former depressions in the flood plain area silting up. Woodland became increasingly waterlogged and died off, and the landscape would have become much more open.     Because of the potential for Mesolithic archaeology, related to hunter-gatherer-fisher activities centred on the gravel island and exploiting the nearby resource rich wetland of the channel marginal zones, and for associated deep organic sequences preserving significant palaeoenvironmental data concerning the development of the River Thames in east London, the results from North Woolwich Portal are assessed as being of regional significance.  </value>

The current report provides the results of the second season of archaeological investigation of a 3.7ha field called Little Stiances, located at Sharpsbridge Lane, Newick, East Sussex. This work was carried out in June 2013.    Geophysical and topographic surveys carried out in 2010 confirmed the location of a 'lost' cottage known from cartographic sources and allowed the targeting of test-pits at that location both in 2010 and during the second season of investigation in 2013. This year the 'Cottage Site' again produced a range of finds reflecting the occupation of buildings in that part of the field mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Finds ranged from pottery, glass and clay pipes to the bricks and tiles from demolished building(s), to more 'personal' artefacts such as the remains of a knife, a fork and a number of decorated buttons. Some of the character of the interior of the building(s) is shown by the survival of door fittings, and part of a decorative metal plate, probably from the cooking range. Peculiarly the excavation this year also yielded metalwork elements from a number of different sizes of shoe, and the remains of part of a leather boot, complete with brass eyelets.    Investigation of a smaller 'House Platform' adjacent to a sunken lane (both identified during the topographical survey in 2010) uncovered evidence of medieval activity represented by a small assemblage of 13th to 15th century pottery.

Just three pieces of residual struck flint were recovered from the site indicating only very limited earlier prehistoric activity in the vicinity. A single blade was most likely of Mesolithic or Early Neolithic date. No date could be confidently attributed to the other two pieces.     The earliest visible occupation of the site occurred during the Late Iron Age/ Early Roman period, dated to between AD10 - 60. A small settlement was identifiable from a single roundhouse with an internal diameter of 6.6m. It is unclear whether the settlement was enclosed or otherwise. Associated evidence of small scale iron smelting was recovered in the form of dumped deposits of fresh smelting slag and hearth lining, but no furnace or in situ deposits were identified.     A return to the site was apparent in the 12th century with the creation of a system of narrow strip fields around a central spinal boundary. No evidence for settlement was recovered, instead the data suggests agricultural activity with possible small associated agricultural structures set some distance from the settlement core.  </value>

The excavation that was undertaken successfully identified 2 main phases of archaeological activity. These were located within 3 distinct areas along the length of the cable trench route. The first phase of activity was evidenced by a multiphase deposit of worked flint that appears to have been principally created during the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. The second phase was evidenced by two areas of activity, with features dating from the mid to late Iron Age. One of the sites was positioned alongside the flint scatter within the valley bottom. Whilst the second was towards the southern end of the route, utilising the more elevated topography to the south of the West Glen valley.</value>

The project was undertaken on behalf of SLR Consulting Ltd. for Hanson Building Products Ltd. and will form part of an overall Environmental Impact Assessment of the proposed development.    A programme of test pitting and trial trenching has refined our understanding of the palaeo-topography and environmental sequence at King's Delph, and identified a significant prehistoric landscape. An important assemblage of finds from a buried soil horizon in the west of the site represents activity dating from the Late Mesolithic to the Early Bronze Age, peaking in the Beaker period. In addition two preserved wooden stakes / posts have been dated to the late Neolithic and Beaker periods. Of greatest significance is the discovery of a previously unknown round barrow along with potentially associated features including a possible bank. Associated finds include Beaker period pottery and human remains.     The evaluation results indicate an important prehistoric landscape is preserved beneath layers of peat and alluvial deposits at King's Delph. Furthermore, conditions encountered during the excavation suggest preservation, particularly of organic remains, is likely to be good where present.   </value>

The earliest archaeological evidence found dates from the Mesolithic period. Neolithic flint tools have been found close to the west and north-west of the site. A possible Bronze Age ring ditch has been identified to the north-east and finds dating to the period have been discovered through metal detecting surveys. Iron Age remains including pits and pottery have been found within the area of proposed development through trial trenching. The site lies between two Roman settlements on the south-western banks of the River Wensum. One lies nearby to the north-west of the site and numerous finds including coins have been discovered during a fieldwalking survey. A further Roman settlement lies to the south-east where two enclosures, two kilns and two burials have recently been excavated. A middle Saxon cemetery, drainage ditches, an enclosure, land divisions and a substantial boundary ditch have also recently been discovered to the south-east of the site. Metal finds dating to the period have also been found to the north-west and to the east of the site during metal detecting surveys. The site lies beyond the historic core of Great Ryburgh. The medieval settlement developed around the junction of Fakenham Road and Bridge Road to the west of the River Wensum, flanked by the medieval moated manor of Ryburgh at the northern end and by St Andrew's Church to the south. Cartographic evidence suggests that the site lay to the rear of properties fronting Fakenham Road during the post-medieval period and had remained as undeveloped farmland.</value>

A total of 45 trenches were excavated.  At the north end of the site the ground rises onto the gravel terrace. Finds indicate that one pit was probably late Bronze Age, one ditch contained later prehistoric pottery and others were Romano-British.   South of the terrace, which dipped onto Gault Clay, a number of ditches  were found and two of these contained later prehistoric pottery.  Pits and postholes were also found in a single trench just off the edge of the gravel  terrace, though none was dated.  A small number of worked flints were recovered from this area, and appear to represent Mesolithic or early Neolithic activity in this vicinity.   In the central part of the site a variety of ditches and gullies were seen, but only one was dated.  On the west side of the site work was targeted on a possible palaeochannel, although no waterlogged deposits or artefactual evidence was found.   In the southern part of the site alluvium was encountered. However, there were no archaeological features, and despite the high water table no waterlogged deposits were preserved.  The limited artefactual material suggests that a field or enclosure system of later prehistoric date may have extended across the area, but the ditches found may alternatively be of several dates.  </value>

A number of small ditches, gullies, shallow postholes, and deposits associated with lithic artefacts were identified. Archaeological features included a possible field system comprising two parallel ditches, one of which contained Bronze Age to Iron Age worked flints, possible Bronze Age pottery, and environmental evidence of former agriculture. The ditch also produced Mesolithic to early Neolithic flints, indicating earlier prehistoric activity at the site.  A single piece of Roman pottery along with fired clay fragments were found in association with two curvilinear gullies. A parallel ditch and gully, both undated, may have been the remnants of a former field system.  A thick layer of colluvium in the north-eastern part of the site apparently filled a periglacial feature, below which a possible 'buried soil' produced environmental evidence indicating that it likely supported a short-turfed grassland. The colluvium and the buried soil both yielded small quantities of Mesolithic to early Neolithic worked flints. Sieving of the topsoil and subsoil samples recovered a small quantity of worked flint, but no significant concentrations were identified.</value>

Across most of the site the level of archaeological activity is relatively low and only 12 worked lithic artefacts were identified in total. The lithic assemblage appears to relate to the late Mesolithic and/or early Neolithic period. A concentration of worked artefacts at the northern end of the field may directly relate to the larger concentrations identified in the east of Hallsteads investigated by Oxford Archaeology North in 2013.

Thirty-one archaeological evaluation trenches and eleven geoarchaeological test-pits were mechanically excavated and recorded.    Significant Quaternary deposits were encountered at the site, offering potential for insight into the distant past.    Archaeological features including pits, post-holes, gullies and masonry were encountered in eleven of the trenches, and some of the test-pits revealed significant quaternary deposits.    The earliest material showing clear human intervention was a background scatter of residual Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork relating to hunter/gatherer activity in the wider landscape.     The oldest archaeological deposits consisted of a concentration of pits suggesting the site was a focus of activity during the Middle to Late Iron Age. However, there was no evidence of Romano-British activity contemporary with the nearby villa complex,    A group of post-holes have been tentatively dated to the medieval period on limited artefactural evidence. As the arrangement strongly suggests the presence of a post-built structure of some kind close to the medieval parish church, the remains of are of obvious significance.

The site lies within the Horncastle Conservation Area and is believed to fall within the area of the extra-mural settlement associated with the Roman walled town generally known as Banovallum. Previous archaeological work at and in the vicinity of The Wong has identified Romano-British field systems and enclosures associated with the periphery of the settlement. At least two phases of activity, represented stratigraphically by the presence of two apparently parallel linear features and a line of post-holes passing across one of the ditches after it had been completely back-filled, were identified during the evaluation. However, the only datable artefact retrieved was a flint blade ascribed to the later Mesolithic or early Neolithic periods, and it seems most likely that this artefact was residual within the ditch fill in which it was found. The evaluation results can speculatively be associated with the known Romano-British field systems and enclosures identified by previous archaeological work in the neighbourhood, but there is at present no concrete evidence for such an association.  </value>

The site was thought to have high archaeological potential as it lay only 100m to the north of the nationally important site at Springfield Lyons.    The investigation initially consisted of a trial-trenching evaluation.  Archaeological features were identified only in trench 4 in the north-east of the site. Excavation of an open area around the trench recorded a boundary ditch aligned north-south, most likely dated to the Late Bronze Age.  Post-holes and root-holes were also recorded, some of which contained single sherds of Late Bronze Age pottery.  Several Mesolithic and Neolithic flints were recovered as residual finds in later contexts.  The edge of a pond investigated at the southern end of the excavated area contained two sherds of Early Saxon pottery, but the pond is not firmly dated and may in fact be relatively recent.      The residual flints reflect an early prehistoric presence in the area and the site's proximity to the Neolithic causewayed enclosure immediately to the south.  The boundary ditch is thought to be a continuation of a linear cropmark recorded to the east of the Late Bronze Age enclosure at Springfield Lyons.  If so, it would have been part of a wider Late Bronze Age landscape around the enclosure, forming a major boundary running along the eastern edge of the boulder clay plateau and along the top of the valley slope of the river Chelmer.   </value>

The NGR for the centre of the site is 538227 179841.    The lithological and palaeo-environmental work carried out on the core samples from Dollar Bay fits well with the wider, original deposit modelling across this area of the Isle of Dogs. The borehole work brought clarity and detail to the site itself indicating the site area existed on a relatively higher part of the floodplain in the early Mesolithic at approximately -2.4mOD.     A peat deposit across the site was radiocarbon dated to the early Bronze Age and reflected the gradual change from an Alder dominated marsh environment with stands of deciduous trees on the higher ground, through to a more open grass / sedge increasingly brackish environment. Cereal production was noted in the upper peats indicative of agricultural activity locally.    The deposit sequence also provided an important record of changing hydrology and relative sea level rise. Evidence for estuarine incursion provided specific dateable and measurable information about the impact of rising river levels and estuarine encroachment.   </value>

The scheme required various archaeological works, including geophysical survey and evaluation; open-area excavations and photographic/topographic surveys; and watching briefs monitoring topsoil stripping in advance of road construction. The sites of principal archaeological investigation included two Scheduled Monuments: Carkin Moor Roman fort and Scots Dyke; open-area excavation of an Iron Age settlement at Rock Castle; open-area excavation of late Iron Age/Romano-British enclosures and settlement remains between Sedbury Home Farm and Scotch Corner; and several archaeological watching briefs. The earliest recorded activity dated to the Mesolithic/Neolithic, comprising residual or unstratified flints, and two radiocarbon dates from postholes. A pit containing pottery and a posthole were dated to the early Bronze Age. The open-area excavation adjacent Rock Castle exposed part of a roundhouse, enclosure ditches and other features of Iron Age date. Further late Iron Age-early Romano-British settlement remains were investigated across the scheme; including several roundhouses and a large number of boundary/enclosure ditches, many of which yielded Romano-British pottery and imported Roman vessels. Significantly, the investigations resulted in re-dating the Scots Dyke from the early medieval period to the early-middle Iron Age. Part of the ditch is of Roman date, forming part of the defences for the fort at Carkin Moor.

There is no evidence of Roman activity in the vicinity and evidence of Saxon occupation is limited. The site lies close to the medieval Manor of Everton, within the medieval core of the village. Several pottery kilns have been found locally, which implies the medieval economy was driven by pottery manufacture. Cropmarks found to the north-east of the village suggest the medieval settlement spread northwards and that medieval settlement remains may lie on the site. Glebe House was the last of three vicarages to be built within the plot. It lies to the east of the second vicarage which was built in 1635 but may occupy the same location as the first building.

As the development lies within an area of archaeological sensitivity, a condition (Condition 10) was attached to the planning consent requiring the implementation of a programme of archaeological work.  This was in accordance with Policy R29 of the Welwyn Hatfield District Plan (2005).    Construction work on the site began without discharge of Condition 10.  As a result, the Historic Environment Advisor for Hertfordshire County Council (HEA) advised that all groundworks should cease until a programme of archaeological work had been carried out.  In order to confirm the archaeological potential of the site and identify which heritage assets (if any) might have been damaged, the HEA indicated that the first phase of work should include an assessment of the impact of the development so far and a trial trench evaluation of the site.      Trial trenching took place on the 20th and 25th June, and comprised the excavation of five trenches located within areas that had suffered least disturbance from construction-related activities.      Two flint artefacts dating to between the Mesolithic and early Neolithic periods were recovered from the subsoil within Trench 1.  Their location in the subsoil, and a lack of any other contemporary finds or features, suggests that at best they can only be considered to be an indication of activity of these periods in the wider area.

The model of the early Holocene or Mesolithic topography indicates the Site occupies relatively high ground in close proximity to ancient channel courses within undulating gravel deposits typical of the floodplain environment.    The assessment work carried out on the window samples from RAD15 indicates their potential to provide a record of landscape change from the Late Pleistocene through to the historic period, which can integrate the Site with models and other site data from the Lower Thames area. Tentative direct evidence of human activity, in the form prehistoric clinker, was found on the Site in conjunction with possible indirect evidence of human activity from microfossil remains within the deposits.

A single small pit was recorded within Trench 1, though it contained no finds; the remainder of the archaeological investigation in this part of the site concentrated on the test pitting and recording of naturally deposited sands and silts. Many of these deposits contained struck flints dating from the Mesolithic to the Iron Age periods, as well as a small quantity of Neolithic pottery.

Five test pits were excavated in this material, with struck flints recovered from each one. The presence of flints and pottery in the subsoil and natural deposits towards the south-east end of the site can probably be attributed to a combination of colluvial deposits from further up the slope and fluvial deposits from the river valley.

Remains from four periods were identified: Mesolithic, Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (LBA/EIA), Late Iron Age (LIA)/Early Roman, Roman and post-medieval/modern.     Mesolithic remains comprised a single pit or tree throw that produced a significant quantity of diagnostic flintwork. LBA/EIA remains comprised three burnt mounds, two of which were dispersed, a curving ditch that produced a significant quantity of probably LBA/EIA pottery and a second isolated ditch that produced later prehistoric pottery.     LIA/Early Roman remains comprised a trackway or droveway, delineated by side ditches that ran broadly parallel to the 'Hook Dyke', and a ditch of the same period at right angles to the trackway that was perhaps an element of a field system. A scattering of undated but possibly LIA/Roman features, predominantly linears, were recorded in trenches immediately to the west and east of the Phase 1 evaluation site. Roman remains dating to the 2nd century AD or later comprised a ditch ran and a small gully.  The ditch was perhaps a later southward extension of the extensive LIA/early Roman field system recorded to the north during the Phase 1 evaluation.     Post-medieval dated features were well dispersed and probably represented field boundaries or drainage features. A broad ditch identified on the eastern edge of the site was perhaps a section of a WWII anti-tank ditch recorded in the vicinity.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The Archaeology Unit of Southampton City Council (Southampton Archaeology) carried out archaeological excavations in the St Clement's Street car park in Oxford, on behalf of the Watkins Jones Group, in association with the construction of student accommodation. The earliest evidence of human activity was a group of worked flints, probably of Mesolithic date (c 9000-400BC). There was no evidence of human activity after that date until the Saxo-Norman period, when three pits were dug. This phase may tie in with the manor of Bolshipton, owned by the St Frideswide's nunnery, and situated in this area. More intensive use of the site happened in the Anglo-Norman period; the evidence consisted of numerous features including pits, postholes and a gully, all bounded on the west by a north-south ditch. Occupation continued into the High Medieval period, although the area occupied in the Anglo-Norman period appears not to have been used, and all the High Medieval features were found to the east of the north-south ditch, which was re-cut. There was a hiatus in the 14th century and the area seems to have been abandoned, or used in such a way as to result in no features or dating evidence. Documentary and cartographic evidence suggested the west part of the site might have been crossed by the Oxford Civil War defences but no evidence was found so they must lie further west than the excavated area. In the second half of the 17th century the site seems to have been turned into a market garden by the Penson family, with the garden being sold off for housing by the 1870s. The houses survived the Second World War but were cleared for car parking in the post-war period.  A number of finds were retained and together with the site records form the archive.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">       An archaeological excavation was carried out on land south-west of Horsley Cross roundabout, Clacton Road, Tendring, Essex in advance of the construction of an industrial park.  Previous archaeological evaluation on the site had revealed evidence of early to middle Roman settlement activity along with some earlier prehistoric remains.      Archaeological excavation revealed a small assemblage of worked flint dating from the Mesolithic/Early Neolithic to the Bronze Age with four possible contemporary pits.  A further 11 pits produced prehistoric pottery, this material dated to the Bronze Age, Early Bronze Age, Late Bronze Age, Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age, and Early Iron Age.  A circular arrangement of prehistoric and undated pits, c 20m in diameter, could possibly have been dug around a levelled mound.    Dating from the Roman conquest and probably continuing into the early 3rd century, the next phase of activity on the development site centred around an irregular field system of ditches, a possible trackway and a scattering of pits.  Pottery from the site comprised of mainly locally-produced coarsewares with the only other finds of note being fragments of briquetage and quernstones (both puddingstone and lava quern).  This likely represents domestic waste from a nearby settlement or farmstead.    A field boundary ditch, large erosion hollow and pit were of post-medieval/modern date.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The recent works, which included the stripping of interior finishes, internal alterations and the creation of new door and window openings revealed the construction of the first floor exterior walls, which were previously largely obscured by interior plaster finishes and  exterior tile-hanging.  The construction comprises small-panel timber-framing, with some footbraces, which were seemingly confined to the service end of the building.  The location of two original mullioned windows was identified, to the front and rear elevations.    The original infill to the first floor timber frame, which is likely to have been lath and daub, was replaced with brickwork, probably during the 19th century when the ground floor was rebuilt in brick; it seems probable this was carried out with the intention of it being obscured by tile-hanging.      The watching brief on the groundworks at the site resulted in the recovery of material dating between the Mesolithic/Neolithic periods and the twentieth century. The presence of prehistoric flintwork is indicative of casual loss during transient activity, ether at, or in the vicinity of the site, while recovered sherds of medieval pottery are presumed to be the result of manuring of the local fields. A large collection of 19th and 20th century material is clearly more directly 'domestic' in origin, from the dumping of detritus close to the cottage. Finds from a midden deposit included pottery, tile, glass, clay tobacco pipe and metalwork.  </value>

The earliest features were a group of up to four earlier prehistoric pits located within a 10m area at c.8mOD. One pit was dated to the Early Neolithic and contained c.200 flint working debitage pieces. Three of these pits produced background evidence for cereal growing. A moderate collection of residual Mesolithic, Neolithic and to a lesser extent Early Bronze Age flint was also found across the site, and flint debitage was concentrated in at least two further areas denoting where other probable flintworking had occurred.      The excavation area lay within land owned by Barnwell Priory, whose former buildings were situated c.200m to the east. Quarrying took place in the late 17th century, seemingly contemporary with other quarry pits found 100m to the east during the 2009 evaluation.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">  Archaeology South-East was commissioned by CgMs Consulting Ltd. to undertake an archaeological evaluation on land to the east of Shepham Lane, Polegate, East Sussex (The Mill Development). Extension of some of the trenches and the mechanical stripping of two Mitigation Areas allowed the examination of a range of archaeological deposits in advance of development.    A limited assemblage of residual struck flints dating from the Mesolithic to the Early Bronze Age were recovered from the overburden and from a limited number of archaeological features. Only a single feature was datable to the Late Iron Age/Romano-British period.     The majority of datable features identified at the current site could be dated to the medieval period, apparently forming a periodically realigned field system in use from the Saxo-Norman period through to the late 13th century. Only limited evidence of post-medieval activity was uncovered during the current project, often in the form of truncation of earlier archaeological features apparently from clearance of trees and bushes.    It is envisaged that the results of the archaeological work from the current site and other local excavations will be assimilated to provide a detailed chronological narrative of the sequence of human activity in the Dittons Road/Shepham Lane area of Polegate.

The excavation identified evidence for late Mesolithic/early Neolithic activity (pits), with more intense land usage in the Bronze Age (enclosures, field systems, buildings, and wells), and occupation within the early and middle Iron Age. Romano-British activity included extensive field systems and pottery manufacture. The site also contained evidence for Anglo-Saxon occupation - an earlier dispersed settlement replaced by an enclosed settlement which continued into the 8th or 9th century. This settlement may have had a semi-official function and been related to Mercian expansion, based on its name 'Conington' (kings town) and the defensive nature of the enclosure.</value>

A geoarchaeological study confirmed that the lithics were not in-situ but redeposited. A small number of undated features, including pits and possible postholes, that contained small quantities of worked flint artefacts and chips or burnt flint fragments, may be of (later) prehistoric periods and represent episodic and transient settlement.

The report is written and structured so as to conform to the standards required of post-excavation analysis work as set out in Management of Archaeological Projects 2 (Andrews 1991). Interim analysis of the stratigraphic, finds and environmental material has indicated a provisional chronology, and assessed the potential of the site archive to address the original research agenda, as well as assessing the significance of those findings.

The finding of two flint flakes on the stripped surface points to a low level of  use in Mesolithic or Neolithic times, with the pieces likely to represent casual loss or discard within the wider landscape setting.   A number of linear features were recorded which were of post-medieval date from the pottery and other items they contained. A single sherd of pottery may be of late medieval date, but was recovered from a post-medieval ditch. Some of the boundaries are depicted on the Ordnance Survey maps of 1875 and 1900 and from the few stratigraphic relationships present, a reorganization took place in the early 20th century.</value>

An Iron Age hillfort has been discovered to the south of the site (HER8106) with multi-period occupation starting during the Mesolithic/Neolithic and used into the medieval period. A Roman hypocaust was discovered immediately to the south of the site (HER8340) although the centre of the Roman settlement was located to the south-east. The town was populated during the Saxon period although the centre of the burh has never been discovered. The town prospered during the medieval period, but was never an influential settlement. In recent years land around Witham has been increasingly developed.    Three features were recorded during this second phase of evaluation at the site; a Posthole (F1005), a Ditch (F1008) and a Gully (F1009).

The evaluation was undertaken in compliance with the initial requirements of a planning condition attached to planning approval for proposed construction of a detached residential dwelling, garaging, parking, access and associated works (East Cambs Council Ref. 17/01023/FUL), based on the  advice of Cambridgeshire County Council Historic Environment Team.      The trial trench evaluation recorded low quantities of prehistoric artefacts of likely Mesolithic date, comprising flint blades, animal bone including deer, and burnt flint potentially used as pot boilers.  These artefacts were recovered from ditches and pits, predominantly in Trench 2 towards the front of the site, but it is unclear if these features are of prehistoric origin, and it is unlikely they are Mesolithic in date.  However, this low quantity of finds provides further evidence for Mesolithic activity on the margins of the fen island.      The results do not correlate closely with other archaeological remains in the vicinity, though it is clear enclosures were established from the Bronze Age onwards on surrounding land at Soham.  Investigations to the north of The Butts recorded sparse Bronze Age activity and flint work (CHER MCB17961), while along Fordham Road investigations have revealed extensive evidence of prehistoric, Roman and medieval settlement/occupation and further significant Saxon inhumation burials (CHER ECB4586, ECB455, ECB3613  and  ECB4556).

The fieldwork was commissioned by Waterman Group in advance of the redevelopment of the site.    The earliest activity on the site is represented by residual Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flint working.    The most significant aspect of the archaeology is evidence of Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (c.800-600BC) activity on the site, consisting of various enclosures/field boundaries, pitting and possible structures. The density of activity from this period within a relatively small area suggests the site is part of a much wider Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age landscape.     Some later Iron Age/Early Roman activity (40BC-AD70) is also present on site. This phase of occupation is smaller scale than that of the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age, with much of the later activity focused on pits, thought to be small scale gravel quarrying, however there appears to be some continuation in how the site is being utilised, with enclosure ditches conforming to earlier alignments, and a possible later intentional deposition of artefacts within an earlier ditch terminus.    The final phase of activity on the site is the building of Bedford Lodge and the laying out of the orchards and formal gardens in 1815. This building is extended in 1823 and again in 1836.    The whole site was demolished in 1955 and a tarmacked playground for Holland Park School built upon it.  </value>

This project seeks to contextualise finds within reconstructed palaeo-landscapes.  An important element of these reconstructions is the dating of local and regional sealevel rise.  Current methods for obtaining and correctly dating cores are being developed by the project and rely on novel vibro-coring techniques.  If these prove successful they will have widespread application across a range of Scottish (and other similar) settings and over a range of different time scales.  An important element of the tests is obtaining dates from the cores often from material that contains little carbon and thus are not suitable for C14 dating.  The project will test the applicability of different dating including C14 in comparison to luminance dating.  Richard Bates 2013.</value>

The proposed works comprises ditch infilling towards the western side of the Wildlife Reserve. Known designated and non-designated heritage assets were assessed within a 1km study area around the site.  Whilst there are designated heritage assets within the study area, there is not considered to be a risk of impact to their setting due to the low visual impact of the works.  There is potential for evidence of prehistoric activity within the Site, with discoveries of numerous Mesolithic surface finds within the eastern area of Graffham Common. The Site was likely utilised during the medieval and post-medieval period as either pasture or managed woodland. There is also potential for small scale industry in the form of quarrying.  Due to the scale of the proposed works it is unlikely that undisturbed archaeological remains will be encountered, with the archaeological potential based upon the recovery of surface finds. Similar finds are already well documented in the area, and additional records are unlikely to add much to our knowledge of prehistory activity in the area beyond its extent.

This collection contained a relatively high frequency of bladelets and platform cores, with a variety of retouched pieces including notches, scrapers, awls and burins. The assemblage as a whole appeared likely to be Mesolithic, although other than a microburin and a backed bladelet there was no evident microlithic component. A barbed and tanged point indicated a later prehistoric presence. Having shown the collection to Prof Steven Mithen and Dr Karen Wicks, both based at the University of Reading, subsequent seasons of fieldwork have been carried out in the back garden in 2006, 2010 and 2014 funded by the University of Reading and Historic Scotland.    Excavations have shown that below the topsoil there was a complex series of inter-cutting and truncated features containing Mesolithic artefacts that had been heavily disturbed by recent cultivation within the garden.  Substantial hearth-like features set within a circular arrangement of probable post-holes and stake holes indicate the presence of a hut. Radiocarbon dates obtained during 2006 and 2010 indicate an initial phase of activity associated with the Mesolithic artefacts dating to c. 10,300 cal BP, followed by a second phase possibly associated with the use of the hut c. 1000 years later.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between 30th May and 8th June 2017, Oxford Archaeology undertook an archaeological evaluation comprising 28 trenches on Land off Hinckley Road, Sapcote, Leicestershire. The work was undertaken to inform the local planning authority in advance of a submission for a proposed housing development.    Geophysical survey of the site had identified the probable presence of medieval ridge and furrow at the site, but no other significant features were recorded.     A total of 28 trenches were excavated and significant archaeological features were present in 12 of them. The other 16 trenches were either devoid of archaeological features or only contained furrows or natural features, for example root bowls.    Three phases of activity were recorded across the site: late Bronze to early Iron Age, late Iron Age to Roman and medieval to post medieval. A flint tool of likely Mesolithic date was recovered from a subsoil deposit. Activity associated with the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age was confined to a single ditch within the south-east corner of the site.    Ditches dated from the late Iron Age and Roman period are indicative of agricultural field systems. Their comparable alignments and the pottery recovered from the fills suggest only a single phase of activity. Features uncovered during these works are likely to form part of a nearby settlement's agricultural hinterland.    Medieval and post-medieval features can be associated with agricultural management. East-west aligned furrows, as suggested by the results of the geophysical survey, were present within several of the trenches.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between the dates of 05/05/2011 and 20/05/2011 Oxford Archaeology East carried out an archaeological excavation to the south of Stansted airport. The site is located within an area known within the greater Stansted airport development as South Gate, the sites southern boundary being formed by the east, west running A120.   Prior trial trenching was not required on the site, due to the extensive previous excavations surrounding the site. A brief was issued subsequent to the stripping of the agreed excavation area.   The excavation of the exposed archaeological deposits revealed Prehistoric  remains that included a sequence of inter-cutting pits, some of which contained pottery of Bronze Age date. These features possibly represented watering holes that were either in continuous use or re-visited perhaps seasonally over an extended period of time. A large number of amorphous tree throws were recorded throughout the excavation area and a small number of these contained worked flints dating  from the Mesolithic to early Bronze Age.  Early Romano-British field systems were also identified that formed part of a wider network of fields recorded during previous excavations.  At the western end of the site a palaeochannel was seen running roughly north-west to south-east. The deposits within the channel contained well stratified finds from each of the aforementioned periods, up to the post medieval period.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The proposed development area lays to the east of Hundred Acre Wood which, according to cartographic evidence has been woodland for at least 150 years. There is a high density of archaeological features known in the vicinity of the site from aerial photographs and recorded by the historic environment service. These included a large number of military training and defensive installations dating to the First and Second World Wars. Pits, thought to date to the Late Saxon or medieval period, and a Bronze Age burial mound have been located within 200m of the site. There is also a significant density of worked flint, dating to the Mesolithic and Neolithic,within 500m of the site.  A walk-over survey was conducted at the site on the 10th October 2013. A zone in the northern and eastern part of the site was in use as plots for static homes. An extant disused building stands to the south of the plot whilst the ground to the north of this had been prepared for another building of similar dimensions which was not constructed. This area consisted of open foundation trenches and up-cast from these works.  A wall, probably dating to the post-medieval period or later was the only archaeological feature identified within the proposed development area. Other archaeological features were identified beyond the boundary of the proposed development area. These included a stone wall a possible post-medieval date, associated with the extant public footpath, as well as trenches and a spigot mortar base dating from the 1940s.  </value>

The work  was carried out on behalf of Rising Star LLP, in advance of the construction of a  new hotel. The work revealed evidence for the footprint for a medieval timber  building, possibly the pre-cursor to Poyle House, and contemporary  drainage/boundary ditches. Features associated with the post-medieval Poyle  House were also recorded, including the late 19th-century ornamental moat and  boat house and a revetment wall on the southern edge of the Poyle Channel. The  works followed on from an excavation within the footprint of the hotel in 1999, also  by OAS (then the Oxford Archaeological Unit), which revealed residual Mesolithic  and late Neolithic/early Bronze Age worked flints, medieval structural remains and  several medieval and later boundary/drainage ditches.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between 8th - 9th October 2013 Oxford Archaeology East conducted an evaluation on land to the rear of The Walkdens, Ashwell, Hertfordshire. The site was approximately 0.5 ha in size and the evaluation comprised six trenches totalling 180m. Geophysics had previously been carried out at the site and had identified a Bronze Age barrow, approximately 25m in diameter, which is one of three located within the field. Trench 1 was positioned across the diameter of the barrow; in both excavated sections the ring-ditch was shallow, measuring a maximum of 0.2m deep. As a result, Trench 6 was opened, to determine whether the ditch was a similar depth to the east. Surprisingly, the ring-ditch was deeper in Trench 6, measuring 0.5m deep. No burial or human remains were identified, either within, or associated with, the barrow. A small undated pit or hollow was excavated inside the area of the barrow, close to its southern edge. Nearby, a similar feature was only partially exposed and remained unexcavated. The only other features encountered during the evaluation were two tree throws in Trenches 2 and 4.  Finds were rare, totalling two small fragments of animal bone (one cattle tooth and one pig tooth, 32g), a small heavily patinated flint blade of Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic date, which had broken in antiquity (1g) and a single tiny sherd of pot (1g), all from the barrow ring-ditch in Trench 6. Three bulk samples were taken to assess the quality of preservation of plant remains and their potential to provide useful data. Plant remains are sparse and are preserved by carbonization (charring) caused by exposure to fire. The better preserved grains can be tentatively identified as a prehistoric hulled wheat, either emmer or spelt. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An open area excavation was undertaken during October and November of 2017, followed by a watching brief. Mesolithic to Bronze Age activity in the area was attested by a small assemblage of five worked flints, indicative of intermittent use of the site. At least one pit and possibly more provide evidence of a more substantial presence in the later prehistoric period , probably in the Middle to Late Iron Age. A small quantity of Romano-British pottery and smelting and primary smithing slag was recovered from the site. A curvilinear gully and a possible enclosure in the north-western part of the site could have dated from this period. The slag was concentrated in two areas, one centred on a pit in the north-eastern quadrant of the site, the other located next to the southern edge of the excavated area. The former may have been associated with an undated enclosure.  The undated enclosure was superseded by a rectilinear arrangement of enclosures, dated as probably Middle Saxon, on the basis of a radiocarbon date and a sherd of pottery retrieved from one of the ditch fills. The partial remains of a post built structure were recorded on the western side of the excavated area, and the analysis of environmental samples indicated domestic occupation during the Anglo-Saxon period, probably in or near the southern and western parts of the site. A series of north-to-south aligned shallow furrows overlying the earlier ditch systems indicated ridge and furrow cultivation in the medieval and probably the post-medieval period.      </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In April 2005, Archaeological Solutions Ltd conducted an archaeological desk-based assessment at Laybrook Quarry, West Sussex, as part of a Review of Old Mining Permission (ROMP). The area has seen limited archaeological work and there is little evidence for human activity prior to the post-medieval period. Excavations at South Hill Farm in 1934, c. 2km to the south-west, revealed evidence for an Anglo-Saxon structure dating to the 6th-8th century, along with Mesolithic flint work and pottery dated to the Roman and medieval periods. Evidence for the presence of humans during the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age periods are known in area, although these occur mostly to the south on the South Downs. The route of a Roman road is recorded c. 4km to the south at Washington, and Stane Street, linking Chichester to London, lies to the west at Pulborough. The Laybrook area was occupied by the 13th century and cartographic evidence suggests the site has been used for agriculture, principally arable. Most of the site lies in the parish of Thakeham although the eastern part lies in what used to be Warminghurst parish (now part of Ashington). The parish boundary is thought to date back to the Anglo-Saxon period.     The assessment established little potential for archaeological remains from the prehistoric, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods, however there is the opportunity for remains from the medieval and post-medieval periods associated with agricultural practices, such as field boundaries.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">  The oldest material encountered at the site consisted of a thin scatter of prehistoric flintwork recovered mostly from the overburden. Some of the material appears to be Mesolithic/Neolithic in date and is probably indicative of transient hunter/gatherer activity rather than sedentary agriculture or settlement.    A thin scatter of mostly charcoal-rich pits was encountered in Area A, dated to the Middle to Late Iron Age on the basis of C14 dating. However the first tangible changes to the landscape occurred in the early Romano-British period when a ditched enclosure was established in Area B overlooking a valley to the north. Material recovered from the enclosure suggests that an iron producing bloomery furnace or furnaces were in operation in the vicinity in the first and second centuries AD, although the actual furnace(s) lay outside of the site boundary. A further short stretch of gully of a similar date was encountered at the eastern edge of Area A.    Area A was divided by a field boundary at some time in the medieval or early post-medieval period, and this boundary survived until the excavation of minepits for the extraction of iron ore, which clearly respect its alignment. These workings probably relate to the Heathfield Furnace complex, which lies c.2km to the north-east and was in operation between the 1690s and 1790s.    The minepits were encountered in both of the excavated areas, and showed some localised variation in distribution and character, notably on either side of the fields boundary in Area A, and in clusters of pits marked by a different methodology of excavation resulting in a distinctly dissimilar plan to the other minepits. Two hearths for roasting ore were presumed to date from this period, possible evidence of on-site quality control of the excavated ore.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The excavations have revealed unique evidence of a wide range of features dating from the Mesolithic/early Neolithic up to the 20th century. The earliest features comprise a scattering of shallow pits and probable tree holes from which Mesolithic or early Neolithic struck flint and Neolithic pottery was recovered; this activity was focussed at the northern end of Area B.    The most significant findings are likely to belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age and consisted of a cremation cemetery located at the north-east corner of Area A. It comprised a cluster of 26 unurned cremations deposited in small pits positioned in and around a ring ditch likely to be the remains of a small round barrow.  Additional Bronze Age activity comprised a small number to pits spread across the site, including a possible well located towards the north western corner of Area B. The Roman period is primarily represented by possible ditched field system revealed across both excavation areas, together with a single pit located at the north end of Area B. The finds evidence was generally quite sparse however, suggesting Roman occupation of the site was limited and that the finds may be residual material in later features. The Saxon period is primarily represented by two large pits at the northern end of Area B and by finds from a large shallow depression further south in Area B.  The latter may be a later feature containing residual Saxon material. A single L-shaped ditched enclosure at the north-west corner of Area A is the only feature of medieval date.  The function of the enclosed space is unclear; however, an agricultural use seems likely. The post-medieval period is represented by an agricultural field system aligned with the extant field boundaries on site; some of the ditches revealed during the excavation appear to be depicted on the 1841 tithe map of the area and align with observed crop-marks.</value>

The site is situated within an archaeologically rich landscape, approximately 500m east of the Roman fort at Brampton Old Church and within the vicinity of several other prehistoric and Romano-British remains. Initial investigation of the proposed development site revealed several archaeological features of interest including several charcoal filled pits, some of which contained pottery believed to be of Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age date. As a result, Cumbria County Council's Historic Environment Service (CCCHES) requested a programme of archaeological work, which included the excavation of two open areas within the footprint of the proposed development area.   The archaeological excavation was undertaken over five days between the 20th March and the 26th March 2013 and involved the excavation of two open areas, measuring approximately 112m2 and 68m2 respectively. The investigation revealed a series of buried archaeological features, included several charcoal filled pits and a possible linear boundary feature. Several sherds of pottery were also recovered from some of these features which have been dated to the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age period. This is significant as this period of Cumbrian prehistory remains poorly understood. Furthermore, this new evidence taken together with previous discoveries, suggests that the site lies within an archaeologically rich landscape which witnessed continued occupation from the Mesolithic period through to the Romano-British period.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Over a period of two days in January 2015, a programme of community field-walking was undertaken on a field immediately west of the church in the village of Covehithe in Suffolk. The fieldwalking was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund as part of the Touching the Tide programme along the Suffolk coast and enabled 36 local residents and volunteers living in the surrounding area to take part in the fieldwalking which was supervised by Access Cambridge Archaeology at the University of Cambridge.  Although only one field was walked during the survey a number of inferences can be made from the results. The earliest evidence is a thin scatter of worked flint dating from the Mesolithic period through the Neolithic and into the Bronze Age. Romano-British settlement is hinted at by the volume of pottery found during field-walking, possibly associated with a linear feature which may be a road sited to the north of the survey area. The settlement appears to have been founded in the middle Anglo-Saxon period and grew vigorously in the later Anglo-Saxon period. The settlement was at its peak during the medieval period, and saw little in the way of any decline after the Black Death. In the post-medieval period the community east of the church may have migrated westwards onto the field-walked area in the face of coastal erosion, but by the 19th century settlement west of the church was in decline, thinned out to leave just a couple of cottages.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A moderate assemblage of worked flints, mostly undiagnostic and with a broad date range, demonstrates activity in the vicinity of the site during the Mesolithic to Early Bronze Age periods. The prehistoric flints mostly occurred as residual finds in later deposits. A small amount of probable earlier Iron Age pottery, also residual, provides further evidence for prehistoric activity in the area.    The evaluation revealed significant evidence for occupation in the Roman period.    Roman pottery, ranging in date from the 1st- to 4th century AD, was recovered from fills of a ring ditch associated with a suspected Bronze Age barrow FRK 008. This suggests either that the monument was constructed in the Roman period or that a prehistoric barrow was re-used at that time.    Roman features, notably pits and ditches and some possible postholes, were found throughout the site but were concentrated in central and eastern areas, suggesting a settlement in the vicinity of the ring ditch/barrow. Fragments of roof tile from several of these features suggest that there was one or more substantial buildings nearby, although no in situ building remains were found.    A north-south ditch in the western part of the site produced 3rd-century Roman pottery and a coin of AD 275-285. This was probably part of an extensive, rectilinear ditch suggested by the geophysical survey, forming a large enclosure associated with the Roman settlement.  </value>

Evidence of early occupation around Legbourne is sparse, however settlement dates from the late Saxon period, and Legbourne Priory was built in 1380. The site lies close to the historic core of the village, and a predetermination scheme of work identified the potential for archaeological remains within the site which would be destroyed by the landscaping project.   A strip, map and recording scheme was undertaken in advance of landscaping in a new pond area where archaeological potential was identified in the preceding evaluation. In other areas, groundworks were monitored where the landscaping impacted into archaeologically sensitive depths.    No archaeological features were identified in the watching brief phase. The eastern half of the excavation area was characterised by historic pond deposits, thought to date from the Saxon/Medieval period.

The earliest finds included Mesolithic microliths along with Mesolithic or Early Neolithic blades and cores.

The most surprising discovery was the existence of a series of Middle Bronze Age field systems, enclosures and settlements that covered large areas of the site, in a part of region where such activity had not previously been recorded. The earliest land divisions were thought to be a series of linear ditches forming strip fields, orientated north-west to south-east, which survived to varying degrees through the entire site. A more intricate system of enclosures and field boundaries was constructed over these early ditches. Finally, discrete areas of settlement were established within the system of fields and enclosures (three were identified across the site).

<value columnNumber="1">A topographic survey was undertaken in April 2011 as part of a programme of archaeological mitigation in advance of works at Dalfad surface coal mine, near Muirkirk, East Ayrshire. Previous surveys had established the existence of a number of agricultural and industrial sites within the development area, primarily relating to 19th century limestone and coal extraction. The present work aimed to create a permanent measured and photographic record of two coal pits and a substantial linear limestone quarry (along with associated spoil heaps and railway branches), and a small area of rig and furrow with an associated bank or dyke. Though weathered and altered in places by more recent development, the industrial remains still bore considerable detail, especially with regards to the alignments of the railway branches serving the works. The rig and furrow was no longer visible at the time of the survey, though a small spread of stones may represent the remains of the bank/dyke.     As part of the same mitigation programme, a known area of peatland, Dalfad Moss, was investigated in order to examine the nature and depth of the peat sediments across the area of the moss. A manual gouge auger was used to investigate peat depth and a Russian corer was used to take a core sample of the peat at the deepest and shallowest locations in order to date the base of the peats. The results of the investigation showed that peat depth varied across the peatland between 0.4 to 6m. A generalised sediment sequence across the peatland showed raised mire monocotyledon peat with wood fragments towards the base, underlain by a peaty clay layer, which in turn was underlain by glacial deposits. Radiocarbon dates from the peat show that it began to form in the Late Mesolithic period between 6650-6480 cal BC (SUERC-34418; 7745&amp;#177;35 BP) and 4990-4790 cal BC (SUERC -34417; 6000&amp;#177;30 BP)</value>

This comprised the machine-digging of five test-pits, the cleaning and recording of a section of a modern dyke, a borehole survey and the excavation of a trial trench.   The presence of alluvial deposits in BH4 and BH5 confirmed the course of the Medieval Yaxley Lode as indicated from the desk study.  However, these deposits were heavily truncated and found to be completely truncated in the dyke and trench sections making an exact plot of the former course impossible.   The test pits excavated on the western margins of the pre-existing Whittlesey Mere recorded the significant thickness of Upper Peat in this part of the site, overlying and protecting Barroway Drove Beds and a Lower Peat sequence which retains the potential to yield buried surfaces and archaeology from the Mesolithic, Neolithic and early Bronze Age periods.

The works took place at one of BT's 'remote sites', situated at Brew Farm, Sennen near Land's End on a site that has a long history of communications use, spanning its WWII use as a part of Britain's early warning system through to the modern-day installation of three satellite dishes.   The watching brief monitored the excavation of geotechnical test pits and the topsoil stripping, ground reduction and levelling of a new compound area, which had new equipment support trenches dug down through it in to the natural. In addition, two trenches were excavated running along the existent access track and up towards the new compound, plus the track itself was extended to accommodate use of the new compound.  A single Mesolithic flint and a probable prehistoric hammerstone were found; a potential medieval (or earlier gully) was partly seen and recorded close to the compound; part of the remains of the known northernmost WWII building (probable Operations Room) with blast-proof walling was recorded on the southern edge of the compound; plus, many communications-related, power and service-associated features were noted throughout - some of which were recorded.  The archaeological findings are entirely in keeping with the known and suspected past sporadic use of the site, with artefacts and remains spanning the prehistoric period through medieval, WWII and up to the modern-day.

<value columnNumber="1">Between the 27th June and 26th September 2013, Oxford Archaeology East carried out a Strip, Map and Sample excavation during the construction of an agricultural reservoir at Rosedene farm, Methwold. The works entailed the excavation in spits of between 0.6 and 2.4m of peat, across a 9.4 hectare site.  A total of five utilised tree throws, containing charcoal, animal bone and struck flint were found at the bottom of the archaeological sequence, underlying the peat. The struck flint assemblage included Mesolithic microliths   The project revealed that prior to the formation of the peat, the area was heavily forested. From the Late Neolithic onwards conditions gradually became wetter, turning first into Alder Carr fen woodland and eventually into a large body of water, potentially by the Late Bronze Age. The carbon dating could not elucidate this any further as a result of obligate water plants fixing ancient carbon from the chalk.  Within the upper part of the Alder Carr wood peat, evidence for beaver activity was identified with the recovery of beaver hewn wood, forming a lodge or food store.  Fragments of stone axe cut wood were also recovered from this deposit.  A post-medieval willow drain was found at the top of the archaeological sequence cutting into the underlying peat.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Wessex Archaeology (WA) was commissioned by Swindon Borough Council (the Client), to undertake an archaeological trial trench evaluation associated with a proposed development at Wichelstowe, located to the south of Swindon, Wiltshire, centred on National Grid Reference (NGR) 413075, 183020.  Archaeological features and deposits were identified in 35% of the excavated trial trenches. The evaluation results have demonstrated that buried archaeological remains are present within the site and include features and artefacts dating from the Mesolithic through to the post-medieval period. Five broad zones of potential have been identified during the evaluation. Two are recorded to the south and east of the shrunken medieval village of West Leaze, where ditches and pits containing Neolithic, Bronze Age and Romano-British pottery were recorded (Trenches 239 - 240 and 250 - 258). The third area of potential relates to Romano-British activity recorded at the western extent of the site, spanning the M4 motorway (Trenches 113 - 127). A further area is coincident with a substantial Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age ditch recorded within Trench 143 in the West Wichel area of the site. A final area of potential interest, more difficult to define, has been identified in the central area of the Site where Mesolithic worked flints and Bronze Age pottery were recovered (Trenches 195 - 200).  Medieval or post-medieval ridge and furrow was visible as earthworks in a number of fields across the site and was subject to a detailed survey in the 1980's. Remnants of the furrow ditches and field ditches were visible, as negative features cut into the subsoil and natural within the trenches. A section of the infilled Wiltshire and Berkshire Canal, constructed in 1804, crossed the West Wichel area of the Site. The canal was visible as a low earthwork within the field and was flanked by a low bank, constructed from up cast clays which, where excavated survived to a depth of 1.6m.     </value>

At Site A, prehistoric landscape features included a middle Bronze Age ditch, pits and postholes. A pair of middle Bronze Age trackway ditches and a late Iron Age ditch was found at Site B, whilst two prehistoric pits and late Iron Age ditches and gullies were also excavated at Site C. A Roman settlement occupied Site C from 1st century to the 3rd/4th centuries, which comprised a series of boundary/enclosure ditches, as well as pits, postholes, a yard surface and a possible oven structure. The area occupied by the yard and oven yielded the most concentrated quantity of late 2nd to late 3rd/4th century pottery, including tile and miscellaneous iron and copper alloy metalwork. The environmental and artefactual evidence indicate that the settlement was associated with mixed agriculture. The CLASP geophysical survey revealed a series of linear and rectilinear magnetic anomalies aligned north to south that was observed to the north of the M1 motorway.  They are interpreted as components of a 'ladder' enclosure settlement, where the Roman site in Site C probably represents the southern end. A subsequent watching brief of trenches across the existing hedgerows and track way (Glassthorpe Road) confirmed the remains of a similar north to south aligned track surface, although it was undated.

Archaeological remains were present in all trenches and the site produced evidence for human activity dating from perhaps the Mesolithic to the early  Roman period.   A small quantity of worked flint typologically dated as possibly Mesolithic represented the earliest evidence for human activity. More convincing evidence for early activity was provided by a small quantity of Early Neolithic pottery (c.3800-3300BC) from a small number of features at the south of the site.   A large ring ditch comprising inner and outer circuits with an apparently discontinuous intermediate circuit is interpreted as a barrow of Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age date. Its diameter of c.80m marks it as among the largest example of this monument type known from the county. and could be the remains of a disc barrow. Cremated humans remains (posibly Early Bronze Age) have been redeposited within the inner circuit ditch.   Two circular structures, one in an enclosure, are Iron Age or Romano British roundhouses. Other ditches define fields, enclosures and possibly track or droveways of several periods.   Roman activity, most noticeably at the south of the site, was associated with secondary metal working and possible cereal processing. The pottery suggested 1st and 2nd century activity, and had similarities to assemblages from military sites. A substantial ditch with evidence for a large internal bank is tentatively interpreted as a Roman earthwork, perhaps part of a beacon or signal station and may have been reused or modified from an earlier 'Thornham' style enclosure.</value>

In addition there were  scatters of worked flints indicating that the area was (probably seasonally) utilised in the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic and Early Bronze Age periods.  A small assemblage of mostly Earlier Neolithic flints including some burnt were residual within probable Early Iron Age features in two trenches in the south-west corner of Field 2.  Elsewhere across the site was a sparse scatter of unstratified flints dating from the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic to Early Bronze Age periods.  Ditches (some large) of probable Early Iron Age date and perhaps enclosing  fields or  paddocks, were found in the south-western corner of Field 2.  These fields or paddocks were generally rectangular and estimated to have been up to 50m in length and between c.13m to 18m wide.  No structures were found, although given the presence of a small assemblage of  Early Iron Age pottery, domestic occupation is likely to have been located somewhere in the vicinity; probably beyond the confines of the development area to the south or west.

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green.

Residual Early medieval pottery was also identified with further Early medieval pottery within a property boundary ditch suggesting that the land was initially divided into two plots at this time, perhaps for agriculture.    In the High medieval period two buildings were constructed on the plots fronting onto Rye Road, with the land to the rear of the northern property being further divided into smaller units. There is a large refuse pits associated with the northern property, and to a much lesser degree in the southern plot also. Some of these contained waster pottery suggesting a close association with the known pottery production site to the north of the site.    The site went into sudden decline in the Later medieval period representing the abandonment of the site and robbing of the buildings to reuse building materials.     Early Post medieval activities are also largely absent with an apparent hiatus of activity between 1550 and 1750 indicating continued abandonment of the site during which time a small amount of colluvium was deposited at the rear of the properties.    During the Late Post medieval period there is little in the way of datable finds although a few potsherds may suggest manuring of the land for arable cultivation.   </value>

The sampling took the form of terrier rig auger samples (AH1 to 5).    The results of the evaluation showed that the site lies within the wider floodplain of the Thames with sands and silts underlying bands of peat lying under historic alluvial deposits which in turn are buried beneath made ground deposits. The model of the early Holocene or Mesolithic topography indicates a relict N/S channel environment within undulating gravel deposits typical of the floodplain environment. The underlying silts were Mesolithic freshwater deposits.  The peat proved to be mid to late Neolithic to mid Bronze Age in date.

Situated across the wider Thames floodplain, all sites analysed were radiocarbon dated variously from the late Mesolithic and the Neolithic periods through to the Bronze Age. Typically from the late Mesolithic, pollen data indicated the area was dominated by oak and hazel woodland on the higher, drier ground, with alder carr (damp woodland) on the floodplain which formed thick peat deposits across nearly all sites. In the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age however, pollen and diatom evidence pointed toward an increasingly saline/open salt marsh environment developing which covered the peats under slowly accreting alluvial deposits up until the post medieval period.    Much indirect evidence was discovered through the palaeo-environmental assessments - particularly through the pollen and plant macrofossil assessments - where cereal production and possible clearance activity was clearly noted throughout the later prehistoric/historic periods.  </value>

A 1m wide 150m long ditch was  also excavated.  No features or finds of archaeological significance were noted within the area of  ground disturbance during this and previous phases of fieldwork. Consequently, the  site as a whole seems to be generally of low archaeological potential, reflecting its use over time for mainly pastoral activities. However, the potential remains for the  recovery of Mesolithic flint scatters and it is therefore recommended that any further  proposals to extend the quarry would require a permanent presence watching brief.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This projects is an investigation of the potential for archaeological remains on land to the south of Highworth Road, Faringdon, Oxfordshire (NGR SU 27903 94777). Historically Faringdon was located in Berkshire, and is an ancient parish.   Mesolithic to Bronze Age archaeology occurs sporadically in the search area, it is considered to be a low to moderate possibility that any features or finds of this date are recovered on our present knowledge. There is a moderate to high chance of Iron Age or Roman archaeology being detected as features of this date, including a Roman shrine, have been located to the southeast of the proposal site. Such sites are important heritage and cultural sites. The activity appears to be located along the spine of a ridge, which runs through the proposal site from the southeast to the northwest. There is a low chance of there being any medieval or post-medieval  archaeology other than agricultural furrows.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">This was the last of the current North-West Cambridge sites excavated. Against background Mesolithic/earlier Neolithic and later Neolithic/Bronze Age flintwork a few Bronze Age features extended into the area's southwestern margin. These were associated with Site II's  MBA paddock/enclosure system and Late Bronze/Early Iron Age settlement cluster. The main phases of occupation were Middle/Late Iron Age and Romano-British, both with substantial assemblages. Of the former, aside from a few 'open' settlement-phase roundhouses, this was manifest by recut enclosures, two with roundhouses, of sub-circular form and of Middle Iron Age date; the third, 'Late' one, was much larger and sub-rectangular.  The site saw continuity of settlement into Early Roman times and, during the first century AD, rectangular compounds were established; associated with the eastern end of a terrace-edge/boundary that ran across much of Site II. Associated with this Early Roman usage was a quarry-field. Based on LiDAR and borehole data, this quarrying possibly resulted in a large wet hollow, which - never subject to later arable production - was responsible for the existence of the copse bordering the site's southern side.  During the later second century AD many 'Early'-phase features had been backfilled with finds-rich midden deposits. Extending along its south-central edge were two sub-rectangular ditch-lines. These appeared to be a part of a third century compound that must run under the copse. With the site beside the former Traveller's Rest Pit Quarry - where Palaeolithic flintwork was recovered - a machine-dug cutting was taken down into the gravels to test for other such finds.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Eighteen trial trenches, totalling 820m, wee excavated on land west of St John's Road, Bungay, Suffolk, in advance of proposed development for housing and employment.  The aim of the work was to characterize the archaeological potential of the proposed development area.  The site is located on an east-facing hillside overlooking a steep-sided stream valley; the stream flows into the River Waveney just under a mile to the north.  The evaluation identified two main areas of archaeological potential.  On the high ground in the north-west of the site (Trenches 1-4) was an Iron Age (probably c. 350 - 50 BC) boundary ditch containing a dump of settlement waste including a large (for the period) assemblage of ironworking slag.  Other features in this area, including a posthole at the end of Trench 3, add to the picture of settlement activity.  In the southern half of the site (Trenches 13-18) was a broadly rectilinear system of field boundary ditches containing flint-tempered Iron Age pottery and later prehistoric (later-2nd- to 1st-millennium BC) struck flint.  No archaeologically-significant deposits were identified in the central (Trenches 7-11) and north-eastern (Trenches 5-6) parts of the site.             Other anomalies identified by a preceding geophysical survey were found to be either natural in origin or post-medieval field boundaries.  One 'kinked' field boundary/ drainage ditch in the south-west of the site is medieval in origin.  A single natural geological feature, located on a sandy knoll in the centre of the southern part of the site, contained a small but homogenous assemblage of Mesolithic struck flint, probably representing some of the debris from an episode of flint-knapping, which became accidentally incorporated into the feature.      </value>

The evaluation revealed data on the medieval and post-medieval landuse of the area. During the medieval period, the whole of the site was in open fields and a number of lawnsheds were still visible as earthworks. The eastern half of the site was enclosed in the late 18th century and remnants of stone walls of two closes were investigated.  In addition, residual worked chert of Mesolithic date was recovered from the southern side of the site and there was a more widespread scatter of residual Late Neolithic/Bronze Age chert across the whole of the field. Almost all the pottery recovered was also residual and ranged in date from the Early Iron Age to the post-medieval period. The Iron Age pottery was widely scattered but the Roman material was concentrated in the southeast corner of the site.  Evidence for the dumping of a large amount of spoil from landscaping associated with the construction of the former Admiralty buildings was found in the southwestern part of the site.

No subsurface archaeological features or graves were encountered during the works; it appears that the western curtilage wall does indeed mark the western boundary of the medieval cemetery, with lower deposits sloping markedly down to the west - although this may have been emphasised by later post-medieval landscaping of soils outside of the cemetery area.      A shallow sequence of deposits was recorded in the area of the north porch which included a recently infilled hollow path, cemetery soils and possible natural sandy-clay geology. Gently sloping deposits on the western side of the curtilage wall included natural clay below a possible archaic subsoil, buried below late post-medieval make-up. Two prehistoric flints in fresh condition were collected from the possible subsoil, which include a small scraper of possible Mesolithic date.    Three sherds of medieval pottery were collected as residual finds in later soils which date from the 12th to 14th century. Other finds amount to two musketballs and a 1953 Threepence.  </value>

Narrow swathes of higher ground forming linear sand ridges were encountered in several trenches, suggesting the underlying topography may have been sculpted by glacial or palaeochannel activity. There were no surviving buried soils encountered on site and only a single ditch was revealed cut through one of these sand ridges.

<value columnNumber="1">The investigations consisted of geotechnical monitoring and a geoarchaeological borehole survey.  The site occupies a low lying part of the Thames floodplain which formed an active channel belt throughout most of the Holocene epoch (i.e. the last 10 000 years). Late Pleistocene gravels were overlain by sands deposited in a partially braided, multi threaded channel. These deposits may date from the Late Glacial or Early Holocene period (c 15 000-10 000 years ago). Above these sands occurred a series of finely laminated clay silts and fine sands interspersed with thin lenses of organics. These were deposited within a wide, single threaded lower energy fluvial environment. The accumulation of the thin organics may relate to episodic channel cut off, which allowed partial vegetation to develop in backswamp areas. These deposits are likely to have accumulated between 10 000 to 2000 years ago (i.e. the Mesolithic to Iron Age period). By the Iron Age the effects of relative sea level rise began to influence the site. The freshwater river transformed to an estuarine environment, resulting in the deposition of intertidal muds within marginal mudflats and salt marsh. The tidal inundation caused aggradation across the floodplain surface raising up the topography significantly. This protected the site from frequent flooding allowing accretionary alluvial soils to develop. These would have consisted of semi terrestrial grasslands, episodically flooded.    </value>

A replacement dwelling has been proposed with a new house footprint which measures c.255m2, within an overall footprint measuring c.0.1ha (Planning Ref:DC/13/0532/FUL).     The site is situated in the immediate vicinity of the Fornham Cursus (FAS 004), parts of which are a Scheduled Monument (SF 114). The cursus, formerly ditches and banks that are now visible as cropmarks, stretches for over a mile between Fornham and Hengrave. It would have been a significant Neolithic landscape feature and is interpreted as a processional way dating to 3500 - 3000BC.     The archaeological evaluation was undertaken in accordance with a brief issued by the Conservation Team of the Suffolk County Council Archaeology Service on behalf of St Edmundsbury Borough Council (Ref: Rachael Monk 08/11/3013/SCCAS).     Two features were revealed at the south-eastern end of the evaluation trench. They comprised of a shallow V-shaped ditch of possible prehistoric date and a post-pit, which it partly truncated. The post-pit contained a post-setting for an upright timber post of c.0.3m diameter. A freshly preserved assemblage of worked flint was collected from the backfill against the former post.

A total of 36 trenches, measuring 1072m, were excavated over an area of 3ha spread between two plots. Eight trenches were located in the southern plot whilst 28 were excavated in the larger northern plot. Part of the trench layout was targeted over anomalies identified during a geophysical survey of the site whilst others were located at random.     A large amount of modern ground build-up and truncation in the southern area meant that natural and archaeological deposits were sealed by up to 1.90m of overburden. Archaeological deposits were located at the south of the southern plot and across the whole of the northern plot with the density increasing to the south and east.  Ditches, postholes and pits were encountered across the whole site.    Artefacts recovered from the site included a small assemblage of struck flints, possibly dating to the Neolithic period, a few fragments of flint-tempered pottery and burnt clay from the south-east of the northern field and a fragment of an Alpine jadeitite polished axe dating from the Late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic period.

Close by, flints dating to the same period were also found in the lower plough soil of the ridge and furrow. Geological changes over the site as a whole were also noted.

The desk-based assessment has established that there is a high potential for archaeological remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age and Post Medieval periods at the site.    The construction of the original school in 1927 almost certainly had an impact on the site, and any archaeological remains that may have been present. Prior to the construction of the new school in the late 1990's no archaeological investigation has been recorded. Therefore it is unclear how large an impact its construction has had on the archaeological record. It is likely that a large proportion of the site will have had archaeological remains removed by the cutting of terraces, or buried under made ground.    In conclusion, due to the past impacts there will be limited surviving archaeology on the site. Due to the previous limited investigation and the unclear nature of any possible surviving archaeology in the vicinity of the works it is recommended that further archaeological investigation is undertaken. </value>

Remains were found in the northern part of the site (Area 1), the  earliest comprising an arc of postholes located along the eastern  edge of a small gravel island on the clay valley floor between the  Rivers Eye/Dikler and Windrush. Radiocarbon dating demonstrated  that these dated to the second half of the 9th millennium BC (the  Early Mesolithic).  A few sherds of Neolithic pottery were recovered from the site, but  most remains were of a Middle Bronze Age cemetery focussed on  the western edge of the gravel island. The cemetery seems to have  been exposed in its entirety and comprised the inhumations of two  adult women and the cremated remains of a further ten unsexed  individuals, comprising eight adults and two non adults.  Radiocarbon dating placed these burials within the middle to late  second millennium BC (the Middle Bronze Age). The burials were  concentrated across an area 29m in diameter and may have been  covered by a barrow, of which no traces survived, but were more  probably within a flat cemetery. The investigation also examined a  possible continuation of the Iron Age ramparts of Salmonsbury  Camp into the southern part of the site (Area 2) but showed that no  such continuation was present. Iron Age remains were restricted to  an abraded pottery sherd within a palaeochannel and a second  abraded sherd within a posthole found within the area of the Middle  Bronze Age cemetery.

These latter consisting first of grey fine-grained sediments with anthropogenic inclusions and capped by demolition and levelling deposits.    Lateral variation in the deposition of tufas and the floristic composition of the peats indicate localised variability in the depositional environment at the site. Whilst thick tufa and reed peats indicative of reed swamp and channel marginal environments occur in the north of the site (Fire Station), wood peats indicative of a wet wooded environment occur in the south (Faberlux Yard).

<value columnNumber="1">Outline planning permission was granted by North Kesteven District Council for a residential development to the south of the A17 at Holdingham Farms, Holdingham, Lincolnshire.  An archaeological evaluation of the site in 2012 revealed two areas of activity; at the north-western corner, and within the south-eastern quadrant, where evidence of burnt agricultural features and timber structures featured in the latter. The results suggested that the site lay within Holdingham's hinterland and, prior to the medieval period, focused on subsistence farming.   Subsequent to evaluation, PCAS Ltd. was commissioned to undertake a scheme of archaeological mitigation works on the proposed development site to ensure the effective preservation by record of the site's archaeological resource.  Excavation exposed a limited number of archaeological features, the majority of which were of likely agricultural origin, dating from the medieval and post-medieval periods. Also exposed was a relatively large penannular ditch, probably a roundhouse, dated to within the middle to late Iron Age. This roundhouse appears to have been relatively isolated in the landscape, perhaps reflecting the importance of its former occupants. A small hearth, tentatively dated to the Mesolithic period was also identified.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Allen Archaeology Limited was hired by Mr P Morley, to fulfil a planning condition for a proposed residential development on land adjacent to Glebe Close, Donington on Bain. The condition was advised by the Historic Environment Team at Lincolnshire County Council following completion of an evaluation of the site (Rowe 2013).   The site is situated in an area of significant archaeological potential. Prehistoric activity in the area can be attested by the proximity to the prehistoric trackway running from Caistor High Street. Flint scatters are also known from the area including Mesolithic-Neolthic flints and Barrows were formerly known south of Donington on Bain, approximately 1km southeast of the proposed development.  Previous excavations south of the development site, uncovered two buildings of 10th century date. Later 12th - 14th century features were also present suggesting this area lay on the periphery of the medieval settlement (Rowe 2014). There are known earthworks near and within the site.  Of more significance was the recovery of two almost complete vessels from this site during evaluation trenching, one of which was associated with cremated human bone. Dating these vessels has been problematic and although an Anglo-Saxon date is suspected, they could represent part of a Bronze Age cremation cemetery.   During the archaeological strip map and record of this site, features from the prehistoric to medieval periods were revealed, mapped and recorded. The prominent phases of excavation revolved around the prehistoric barrow and related Saxon burials.    </value>

The excavation demonstrated that the previously suggested layout of the Late Iron Age - early Roman entrance through the Wheeler Ditch was probably incorrect or incomplete and has provided data to allow a new entrance layout to be postulated. The current project also identified the presence of a small Late Iron Age or early Roman cremation cemetery at the location of the postulated entrance, along with a hollow, which contained a cobbled surface, immediately to the east of the entrance. Stratigraphic and artefacual evidence, which included a substantial pottery assemblage as well as a coin hoard, indicated that the Wheeler Ditch, near to the postulated entrance, was likely to have been in-filled in the earlier Roman period and was, subsequently, re-cut in the later Roman or, possibly sub-Roman or early Saxon periods.

Seven trenches had been previously excavated by Oxford Archaeology East revealing alluvial material containing prehistoric flint and pottery as well as medieval ditches. The current evaluation involved excavating 25 additional trenches. At the west end of the site close to the River Kennett, alluvial hillwash that had filled natural hollows were found to contain pieces of struck Mesolithic and Neolithic flint. At the north end of the site was a large medieval ditch, possibly a boundary ditch for a former plot joining the main street. This contained a single fragment of Greyware. Various undated features including a ditch, gullies, post-holes and bioturbated pits were also found across the site; some of these are likely to relate to the former farm buildings on the site and general farm activity. Close to the bridge over the River Kennet was a large 19th century gravel extraction pit. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In May and June 2020, Cotswold Archaeology carried out an  archaeological evaluation of land adjacent to the A47 at Wansford,  Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. A total of 116 trenches were  excavated. Archaeological remains were identified across the site,  primarily as infilled ditches and small to medium sized pits. These  mainly represented evidence for agricultural activities in the form  of ditches, gullies and pits, of low-level settlement and localised  industrial activity.  The phases of activity identified within the site can be summarised  as follows: Mesolithic or early Neolithic low intensity activity was  concentrated in Priority Area 1, with isolated finds recovered in  Priority Area 4 as well; sparse evidence of Late Prehistoric  occupation was found in the western field of Priority Area 4;  evidence of low-level activity in the Roman period was found in  Priority Areas 1, 3, and 4, with more evident 1st - 2nd century AD  settlement activity recorded in Priority Area 1. The large quarry pits  in Priority Area 3 may be dated to the Roman period as well, though  could be of later origin. After a possible hiatus in the mid to late  Roman period, activity within the site resumed in the early medieval  period. This comprised 5th to 6th century AD material mainly  concentrated in Priority Area 3. The SFB in Trench 91 and the  possible SFB in Trench 92 belong to this phase. The undated  inhumation burials and disturbed neonate remains in Priority Area  4 may be of Roman or early medieval origin too, though this needs  further investigation to confirm. Evidence for medieval and postmedieval  activity, aside from agricultural activity, was mostly  concentrated in Priority Area 4, possibly in connection with gravel  extraction activities.</value>

The scheme is a continuation of previous work carried out at Ash Green Lane in January 2016 (BAL 2016).  Although no archaeological features were present, the finds recovered suggested activity in the area from the Mesolithic or early Neolithic, through the Romano-British and medieval to the post-medieval periods. However, no evidence for occupation, with the exception of post-medieval building rubble from Fields 1, 2, 3 and 6, was identified.  The late medieval pottery recovered from the topsoil/subsoil interface in Field 1 may derive from a pottery manufacturing centre identified in 1969 some 400m W of the pipeline route. The wide scatter of material may suggest that a number of small kilns were present, utilising the marginal wooded conditions known to have existed in this area during the medieval period.  No evidence was found for the burial activity relating to the prehistoric or Anglo-Saxon skeletons excavated in the 1930s and which were thought to have lain at the southern end of the pipeline route.</value>

The evaluation was undertaken in compliance with a planning condition attached to planning permission for the proposed construction of four bungalows (East Cambs Ref. 15/00417/FUL).  It was undertaken based on advice from Cambridgeshire County Council Historic Environment Team (CCC HET) requiring a programme of archaeological work.    The site lies within the medieval and post-medieval settlement area of the village of Little Downham, 100m to the north west of the medieval parish church of St Leonard (CHER MCB14888). A medieval moated site lies to the north (CHER MCB1346) and archaeological investigations to the south west have revealed evidence of medieval/post-medieval occupation (CHER MCB17493). In addition, evidence of earlier prehistoric activity is known from this part of the village.  Mesolithic occupation evidence has been recorded 40m west of the site at Downham Feoffees Primary School (CHER ECB702).    The evaluation revealed two features: a post-medieval or modern pit (F1009) and an 18th/19th century ditch (F1007). The latter ran close to, and parallel to, an extant fence and hedge line suggesting the boundary has been in existence since at least the 18th/19th century.

<value columnNumber="1">This report is a geoarchaeological assessment of strata sampled in ten boreholes drilled at Plot A, Uxbridge Business Park.     Gravels of the Late Devensian Colney Street Gravel Member were encountered at the base of the sedimentary sequence. In several boreholes the Colney Street Gravel Member was overlain by minerogenic alluvial strata of possible Lateglacial to Early Holocene date comprising both channel (lithoclast tufa) and point bar (fining-upwards sandy silt/clay) facies. The minerogenic strata were overlain by peats which formed across the site, most likely during the Mesolithic period. Later, rising base levels led to the formation of a reedswamp across the site resulting in the deposition of organic mud strata. Following the formation of the reedswamp, channels filled with oncoidal tufa deposits formed at the site, overlain in places by thin silt/clay deposits, related to later overbank deposition in a floodplain environment. The sedimentary sequence at the site is capped by modern Made Ground, probably related to the construction of the Sanderson factory, which truncates the Late Quaternary sedimentary sequence.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In November 2011Archaeological Research Services Ltd were commissioned by Cathy Ridington to undertake an archaeological watching brief at 24 Macclesfield Road, Buxton, Derbyshire. The monitoring was carried out during ground works for the construction of a new dwelling to the rear of the house.     The work consisted of the clearing of flowerbeds and scrub from the garden before topsoil stripping of the area. The excavation area was then reduced to the correct level for the excavation of the trenched to begin. An archaeologist was present for all of the above works, but it was deemed unnecessary for one to be present during the excavation of the trenches as the level of the natural substratum had already been reached.     No features of archaeological significance or buried land surfaces were revealed. Systematic sieving of topsoil from the site recovered two prehistoric lithics from the topsoil. Only one of the two flints was diagnostic as a broken or snapped edge-trimmed bladelet segment. This piece belongs to a narrow blade manufacturing tradition and is likely to date to the Late Mesolithic period c.8000-4000 cal BC. These artefacts demonstrate that there may have been some form of human exploitation, either contemporary with or earlier than the Lismore Fields settlement, on this side of the valley. However, these finds alone cannot reveal a great deal about the character of prehistoric land-use at the site.  </value>

Four separate areas were stripped of topsoil and subsoil deposits in order to determine the nature and extent of a number of linear features identified during a previous archaeological evaluation (archaeolo16-168035). This excavation confirmed the presence of a series of ditches, forming elements of field systems of likely prehistoric to post medieval date. A droveway formed of two parallel northeast to southwest aligned ditches, which had been re-cut a number of times, was also identified, which appeared to lead into a likely sub-circular enclosure at the northeast corner of the excavated area. A rectangular possible roasting pit and three possibly contemporary areas of in situ burning were identified within the enclosed area, as was a line of post-holes situated at the enclosure entrance. In addition a number of sub circular pits, two of which contained rake-out deposits of charcoal and ash, were identified across the site. Post medieval glass, CBM and pottery were recovered from three field boundary ditches, while Late Iron Age pottery was recovered from the fill of one ditch in the western part of the site and on the surface of the southern droveway ditch.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation on the site of the proposed new library building revealed further evidence for the occupation on the site dating back to the prehistoric times.Mesolithic activity on or near the site was suggested by a small quantity of worked flint debitage recovered from later deposits. There was clearer evidence for Late Iron Age/early Roman activity which previously had only been suggested by the recovery of Iron Age finds from later deposits. Two ditches may relate to water management of the site but a series of postholes may also indicate the presence of structures. By far, the majority of the evidence dates to the Roman period. A series of intercutting ditches provides a well-dated sequence for occupation on the site through the 1st to the 4th centuries. The ditches and gullies appear to be associated with water management, though the latest Roman ditch in the sequence had a distinctive V-shaped profile characteristic of a boundary or enclosure ditch which may signify a change in character of the occupation during this time. The features were sealed by medieval layers, dating from the mid-11th century. This appears to be the earliest dated evidence for the reoccupation of the site following the short-lived 5th-century Saxon building recorded during the previous evaluation work. Renewed activity in the 17th-century associated with landscaping of the Palace garden was evidenced by a bedding trench and a wide path located near the perimeter wall. </value>

An apparent concentration of Mesolithic and Neolithic worked flint, comprising two retouched blades and a small assemblage of flint-working debitage, was recovered from the northern part of the site, in an area where similar material had been collected in 2011.  Most of the finds collected by the survey, comprising sherds of 18th and 19th-century pottery, fragments of glass and clay pipe, were recovered from a field formerly known as 'Spring Meadow', in the central western part of the site.  Medieval pottery and tile nd an architectural stone fragment of possible medieval date were collected from this field in 2011, leading to suggestions that it may have been the site of a medieval settlement.  However, a geophysical survey of the site revealed no evidence for a medieval building or any other buildings or settlement in this area, so it seems likely that the finds, which include Roman, medieval, post-medieval and modern materials, were imported with soil dumped on the site from other locations which remains of these periods did occur.</value>

The proposal site is located within the middle of buildings with the Grade I Church of St. Nicholas on the south side and the Grade II Red Lion Inn on the southeast corner. The research for the report consisted of a search of the Oxfordshire Historic Environment Records, examination of cartographic sources and a site visit.  The earliest activity within the Islip area is dated to the Prehistoric period, with several records of Mesolithic and Neolithic flints and Bronze Age enclosure. Although it appears that the level of activity decreased during the Iron Age, it is still present and is continued through to the end of the Roman period, with the establishment of a Roman villa. The activity dated from the Prehistoric period to the Roman period is centred to the south of the village with the Prehistoric sites mainly along the River Cherwell and River Ray banks.  The majority of the activity within Islip village is dated from the medieval period onwards, including the establishment of the church of St. Nicholas in the 12th century and possibly late 11th century. As the village developed it became a way point along the road from London to Worcester, and a series of Inns and Coach Houses were established, including the Post-medieval Red Lion Inn. Several of the buildings are still standing within the village and have now been converted into dwellings.   The cartographic and documentary evidence indicates that a medieval chapel referred to as the King's Chapel was located within the proposal site.

Nineteen trenches were excavated across the site to reveal the underlying natural firm mottled light brown-orange/ light grey silt sand clay at a maximum elevation of 56.67m AOD in the east of the site area, falling away slightly to 54.32m AOD in the west of the site (Trench 9).    The investigation has succeeded in identifying archaeological features in 12 of the 19 trenches. A very small quantity of residual struck flint artefacts suggests that there was some activity of Mesolithic to Early Neolithic date in the vicinity. However, much of the archaeological activity recorded appears to be related to a settlement of Early Roman date with a possible eaves-drip gully associated with three postholes an associated field system, and a possibly contemporary land division.     Securely dated medieval activity was limited to a single pit and two intercutting ditches however; these features lay in close proximity to three other undated features which may be contemporary.

On this basis, a further series of boreholes was commissioned with the aim of collecting cores from which appropriate samples could be extracted. Only the most organic sediments and the clayey silts overlying them in the sequence have preserved pollen, and preservation falls off rapidly below the humified organic silts, resulting in little more than 10-15cm of sediment preserving pollen that is potentially countable. The pollen evidence appears to suggest a hiatus between the organic silts at 136-137cm and the clayey silts above at 127-128cm depth. The latter were interpreted as sediments resulting from overbank flooding, and a band of coarser silts at 130-13 could represent an erosional event and account for a hiatus in the sequence at this point, although other factors could also be responsible for a hiatus. The change in habitat from a lime dominated woodland in the late Mesolithic to a much more open landscape in the sediments a few centimetres above is marked, but these upper sediments lack dateable organic remains, although a post-lime decline date in the 2nd millennium BC might be suggested from the pollen.</value>

A sequence of Shepperton Gravel overlain by sandy Lower Alluvium (in places containing a lower organic horizon), Peat, silty Upper Alluvium and Made Ground was recorded.     The surface of the Gravel was recorded at between ca. -9 and -7m OD. The Alluvial sequence overlying it was similar to that at the nearby Pirelli Works site, where the lower organic horizon (recorded at the Nufarm UK site at levels between -8 and -6.8m OD) accumulated during the Mesolithic. The main, generally woody Peat horizon, recorded at elevations between -4 and -2m OD, may be of Neolithic to Bronze Age date. </value>

A small assemblage of struck lithics indicated that the earliest on-site activity probably dated to the Mesolithic, although no features were demonstrably datable to this period. Limited evidence for Roman activity was present in the form of two residual pottery sherds and a piece of tegula. The pottery assemblage was dominated by late Saxon and early Medieval wares. The pottery was generally unabraded and represents good dating evidence for on-site activity. The relatively high density of stratified features and deposits present within the trenches suggested fairly intensive settlement; the earliest phases of which may date to the later Saxon period. The lack of later Medieval wares suggested that the Medieval settlement focus shifted after the 13th Century.

This comprised the excavation of nine areas, totalling C8840m2. In addition, a further six evaluation trenches were opened.   Prehistoric activity was restricted to a cluster of pits and a ditch in Area 4 dated to the middle-late Iron Age on the basis of associated pottery. Environmental samples from these features produced a useful assemblage of charred plant remains and charcoal, especially as the region is noted for a lack of analysed later prehistoric archaeobotanical remains.  Earlier activity in the area was suggested by the discovery of an early Bronze Age barbed-and-tanged arrowhead and two late Mesolithic/early Neolithic bladelets found in an Iron Age pit. No further Bronze Age activity was discovered, despite the presence of an urned early or middle Bronze Age cremation deposit found during the evaluation. The earlier evaluation also discovered two early to middle Saxon pits. No further evidence of this date was uncovered during the present excavation.  A trackway and a number of linear ditches probably relating to field divisions were discovered.

Archaeological evaluation demonstrated human activity of late prehistoric to modern date. Subsequent excavation examined two areas of 4.00m x 13.00m and 5.00m x 7.00m.  The earliest evidence of human activity comprised c.300 worked flints, including axe-sharpening debris and typologically dated as Mesolithic-Early Neolithic. Soil micromorphology identified a relic soil containing most lithics as overlain by up cast material, this up cast tentatively dated as Middle to Late Anglo-Saxon.   The evaluation recorded 10th and 11th-century activity in the north-west of the site on slightly rising ground near the posited location of St Vedast, thought a pre-conquest church. The evaluation also identified a probable north-south road of 12th-14th-century date in the north-west of the site.   Ceramic dating suggests the site flourished in the 14th-16th centuries, its location on low-lying land close to the River Wensum significant for the activities taking place. The presence of two nearby medieval friaries might have influenced this activity.    Evidence of medieval industries thought to be associated with leather, parchment production or perhaps horn working are suggested by a nationally important collection of goat-horn cores from the site. Isotope analysis of goat phalanges suggests sampled animals were raised in north-west Europe, perhaps locally.    Widespread medieval activity was characterised by pits with goat horn cores in areas with chalk or clay floors. The recovery of probable medieval pottery kiln debris suggests other industries at the site.     Activity declines from the 16th century, and deep post-medieval soils sealed earlier remains.   After this little seems to have occurred at the site until the 19th and 20th centuries, when a fish market and a Boulton and Paul ironmongery factory were established.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Oxford Archaeology East carried out an archaeological evaluation on Land at Bartlow Road, Linton, Cambridgeshire. Twenty-one evaluation trenches were excavated across the site, which encompassed two fields located on the eastern edge of the village of Linton.  A detailed magnetometer survey of the site was carried out by Bartlett-Clark Consultancy in advance of the evaluation. This survey was found to provide an accurate prediction of the below ground features that were subsequently encountered on site during the evaluation. Interpretation of these features has been refined and altered by the results of the targeted evaluation trenches. The linear and discrete archaeological anomalies in the southern field were found to be ditched boundaries and pits/quarries of mostly medieval origin, possibly associated with a former trackway that once linked the villages of Bartlow and Linton.   Of particular note was the discovery of an Early Saxon sunken floored building with other possibly associated features, including a pit and postholes, that were revealed in the north-west part of the southern field close to Bartlow Road.   A moderate finds assemblage, including Saxon and medieval pottery, animal bone, CBM and quernstone fragments was recovered, while environmental samples indicate that there is excellent potential for the recovery of charred and mineralised plant and insect remains from Saxon and medieval deposits.  Despite the proximity of Linton Roman villa and walled cemetery to the south and a Saxon inhumation cemetery to the north, the evaluation of the site has indicated that no archaeological features directly relating to these monuments are present on this site. However, a background scatter of ceramic building material of Roman date was found across the southern field that probably derived from the villa. The flint assemblage provides further evidence of activity along the River Granta in the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic periods.</value>

The main phases of occupation dated from the later Iron Age into the 3rd century. The features consisted of burials, pits, ditch systems and postholes. These produced pottery, animal bone, ceramic building material, worked flint, heated flint, lava quern stone, fired clay and shell, as well as crucible and tuy&amp;#232;re fragments. Small finds included an Iron Age silver Cunobelin coin, a fragment of Roman mirror, an awl, clamp/tweezers, goad, weight and a mount, a medieval buckle and a post-medieval coin and ring. The environmental residues produced charcoal, crop and metalworking residues. The three grave cuts (containing remains of four individuals) and the cremation burial dated from the 1st/2nd to 3rd centuries. The cremation contained an adult within an urn and three vessels, possibly interred within a box. One of the inhumations produced two samian dishes and a flagon and also contained a skull fragment of a child alongside the adult female burial. An inhumation of an adult male produced a single jar/flask and a hairpin (probably residual) and nails indicating a coffin. These two inhumations were buried within larger cuts than required.

The potential for significant archaeological evidence remaining in the subsurface deposits led to the Lancashire County Archaeology Service (LCAS) advising that a condition requiring a permanent presence watching brief during all ground work operations be imposed on the planning permission. Consequently, Oxford Archaeology North (OA North) was commissioned to undertake the work between August and December 2012.  The ground works involved the stripping of topsoil to construct a haul road providing access off Skitham Lane to two turbines, a site compound and associated crane/piling pads, excavation of the turbine bases, excavation of cable trenches and substation area, and the topsoil strip of the substation area.   Two pits were observed during the topsoil strip for the haul road. The first pit, 104, was likely to be a modern test pit, and the second pit, 107, was very shallow, and probably a modern machine scrape or scar left by agricultural machinery. A single small animal bone was found within the fill, 108, of this feature.  A possible palaeochannel, 111, and ditch, 115, were identified whilst excavating the cable trench on the higher ground near to the substation area.

Small areas of earlier prehistoric activity were also identified.  Limited evidence for Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic activity was recovered. Three closely spaced Beaker pits, along with a scatter of other similarly dated features and residual finds provided the first certain evidence of occupation, while Early Bronze funerary activity was represented by a ring-ditch  The majority of the deposits were, however, of Late Bronze Age date comprising waterholes and associated roundhouses, structures and pits set within landscape of fields and droveways, elements of which probably pre-dated the settlement. Substantial artefactual and ecofactual assemblages were recovered, mainly from the upper fills within the waterholes and larger pits. The settlement appears to have had a predominantly pastoral economy supported by some textile and bronze production. Ceramics included a notable proportion of non-local fabrics demonstrating that the local population enjoyed a wide range of regional contacts.   Based upon an extensive programme of radiocarbon dating, it is suggested that some of the waterholes and elements of the field systems were laid out during the 12th century cal BC, areas of settlement being subsequently established within this bounded landscape. Dating of charred residues from the substantial plainware assemblage indicates that occupation was focussed in the eleventh century cal BC, perhaps spanning as little as four or five generations.   Cropmark evidence and limited other investigations indicate that the fields and droveways recorded represent a small fragment of a widespread system of boundaries established across the gravel terraces lying between Bredon Hill and the Carrant Brook.     </value>

The centre of the site lies at National Grid reference 556000 176160. The site code is KT-LPS14. Samples were taken from one borehole from each phase and subjected to analysis both lithostratigrapically and biostratigraphically. The stratigraphy found comprised deep alluvium and peats accumulating from the Mesolithic through to the post-medieval period, (the Holocene epoch). The stratigraphy represented diverse environments with the initial prehistoric environment being Pine dominated forests giving way to an Alder carr dominated floodplain which, in turn, gave way to a grass/sedge dominated, tidal environment. Pollen analysis also found evidence of pastoral and arable agriculture that was likely to have taken place within the vicinity of the site.   The assessment has provided an outline, in combination with other geoarchaeological investigations in the area, of the changing palaeo-environment throughout the Holocene in the Lower Thames. The samples obtained from the investigation hold great potential to provide a more detailed picture that might enable the nature and timing of human activity in the locality and its relationship to the evolving floodplain environment to be better understood.

The archaeological work was commissioned by CgMs Consulting Ltd in response to a Brief for Archaeological Evaluation (Stewart 2015) of the Cambridgeshire County Council Historic Environment Team (CCCHET). The aim of the work was to characterise the archaeological potential of the proposed development area.    The earliest activity was represented by several peat deposits sealed below silt and alluvial clay relating to episodes of flooding and marine inundations. One of the lowest peat deposits recorded at the edge of a possible palaeochannel yielded a number of pieces of wood, of which some showed evidence for being worked. Samples of the worked wood were submitted for dendrochronological dating, however no reliable date could be determined from the samples. The sequence of fen deposits, around the Chatteris 'island' and the Cambridgeshire fens, formed as early as the Mesolithic and Neolithic in low lying land, such as rivers and meres, with further peat forming in the later Bronze Age following major lowland inundations. However, aside from some worked wood, no dating evidence was recovered from the deposits in the evaluation trenches.     A number of later, peat-filled ditches were also recorded across the site, cutting through the alluvial deposits, possibly serving as claying or drainage ditches. The drainage of the Fens began initially in the 17th Century although the ditches identified on site were undated and could date from the late 17th to the 19th century. The area around the Chatteris 'island' was drained into the Forty Foot Drain and the Sixteen Foot drain, which were originally cut during Vermuyden's second phase of drainage works in 1651.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Over the five years from 2013 to 2017, 33 1m2 archaeological test pits were excavated in a scatter across the current area of the village of Stapleford in South Cambridgeshire. For the first year the project was included in the Higher Education Field Academy (HEFA) programme run by Access Cambridge Archaeology (ACA) out of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. For reasons of funding constraints, it was then continued as a community dig for the following four years, organised by Stapleford History Society but using the ACA methodology for digging, recording and reporting so as to maintain consistency and comparability.  The project has added confirmation and clarification to the information previously available from the Cambridgeshire Historic Environment Record (CHER) and historical sources. Evidence was found of human activity in the village area from the Mesolithic onwards. In the prehistoric and Romano-British periods the level of activity identified was not such as to suggest that the area had become a centre of regular settlement, though the land was clearly in active use by populations whose main bases were perhaps nearby. The first sign of a settlement dates to the Late Anglo-Saxon period, in a location somewhat to the south of the church. Consolidation into a village can first be seen in the period following the Norman Conquest. Slow expansion was checked by the Black Death, though not dramatically. Over the centuries the preferred locations for settlement shifted a little across the current village area, but Stapleford seems to have remained a rather scattered village, with houses and paddocks strung out along an oval of roads that still give the village its underlying structure. Faster expansion followed the opening of a railway connection in 1845, though much of the centre of the oval, which contained a large common before enclosure in 1812, remained as fiel</value>

<value columnNumber="1">On 14th to 16th May 2019 Britannia Archaeology Ltd (BA) undertook a trail trench evaluation at Gravel Farm, Newmarket Road, Stretham ahead of the erection of a dwelling and associated carport, proposed agricultural units and a retrospective application for proposed container storage unit yard, and proposed demolition of a dwelling. The evaluation was undertaken in response to a design brief issued by Cambridgeshire Historic Environment Team (CCC HET) which required a programme of linear trial trenching to adequately sample the threatened available area.    The site had a low potential for remains of the site relating to the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Iron Age and medieval periods. There was believed to have been a moderate to high potential for remains relating to the Bronze Age and post-medieval periods, and a high potential for finds and features from the Romano-British period.     Despite the potential for archaeological features, no features or finds were found relating to the Bronze Age and Romano-British periods. The features found in the evaluation were mostly undated, the only dated feature on the site dates from the late post-medieval to early modern period. The presence of desiccated fen deposit in the north west of the site might suggest that the site would have been fenland until being reclaimed during the post-medieval period and the land being turned over to agriculture.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation was undertaken at Land off West End Lane, Broadway. It was commissioned by the Environment Agency in advance of a proposed flood alleviation scheme for which a planning application will be submitted.  Twelve evaluation trenches were excavated to test a number of potential archaeological features  which had been identified through cropmark evidence and by a geophysical survey of the site, as  well as the archaeological potential of other areas of the site. The evaluation demonstrated the  good survival of the features represented by the cropmarks and geophysical survey, which largely  comprise negative features cut into the natural substrate generally at a shallow depth.  The most complex archaeology was identified in the central part of the site where a series of  enclosures and other features survive. Most of the features relating to the enclosures were dated  to the Iron Age although some Roman material was also found, suggesting that the settlement may  have been founded during the Iron Age but continued after the Roman invasion.  To the north-east of the enclosures a layer, possibly alluvial in origin, was identified containing a  small number of Mesolithic and Early Neolithic flints. This layer was cut by a palaeochannel and  other features which contained pottery dating to the 11th to 13th centuries AD. This medieval  material is of interest as it appears to pre-date the establishment of Abbot's Grange and the  planned settlement at Broadway.</value>

Between the 20th and 22st September 2017, five evaluation trenches were excavated across a single field specifically to target and characterise a cropmark identified from aerial photographs. The evaluation demonstrated that no archaeological remains were present within the confines of the area of the five trenches. It was revealed however, that deep accumulations of peat were present and it was recommended that further investigation within the agreed study area may be productive and that a programme of palaeoenvironmental investigation could be carried out.   OA North were commissioned by TEP to carry out a targeted auger survey, which was undertaken in January 2018 to collect samples of peat for rapid pollen assessment.  A Russian core reached a depth of 3.5m. Pollen assessment of eight sub-samples suggested the deposit represents a fen-carr peat set within a largely unchanging local environment. A wood chunk and a whole hazelnut, both found in the core sediments at a depth of more than 3m, have returned Late Mesolithic dates. The dates support the assessed pollen assemblages and permit regional comparison with pollen data from nearby Red Moss. There is no evidence to suggest the peat deposits at Bowlands Hey are not in-situ.   </value>

A small, residual assemblage of struck flint attests to at least limited activity of Mesolithic date in the vicinity of the site. A handful of ditches may be considered to form part of a Mid-Late Iron transitional or Late Iron Age field system based on correlations in alignment with dated features from surrounding excavation areas. Much of the activity on the site, however, is medieval in date, comprising a variety of pits, postholes and ditches that probably form part of the agricultural landscape centred on a small medieval farmstead recorded immediately of the north of the site. A handful of post-medieval ditches demonstrate the survival of an essentially agricultural landscape into the modern period.    The archaeological horizon was sealed by a sequence of subsoil and topsoil that reflect the previous agrarian character of the site, though the presence of some areas of made ground also attest to recent activity associated with the construction of the surrounding housing.  </value>

The majority of the proposed Site has been subject to little modern disturbance, and as such archaeological deposits are likely to be in a good state of preservation, although they may have been affected by arable farming techniques from the medieval and post-medieval periods.  The construction of the proposed solar modules, associated substations, inverter cabins, cable trenches and access track have the potential to have a Moderate/Large effect upon archaeological deposits.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation following a geophysical survey was undertaken at Yew Tree Farm, Bushcombe Lane, Woodmancote, Gloucestershire. It was commissioned by Brodie Manning Design and Development Consultancy acting on behalf of the landowner, who is proposing residential development of the site.   The geophysical survey and archaeological trenching showed that there were very few archaeological features across the site area and did not identify any later prehistoric or Roman features. However, although of limited extent, some of the archaeological remains encountered are considered to be of high significance. In the southern part of the site, the radiocarbon dating of two ephemeral pit features demonstrates that these could represent small-scale activity, particularly burning, during the late Anglo-Saxon period.  In addition, part of the site appeared to contain a short-term flint knapping site of Mesolithic date. 56 pieces of flint were recovered within one trench, at the interface between two colluvial layers, suggesting the presence of a sealed early prehistoric ground surface, at a depth of 0.20-0.30m below the present surface. The number of artefacts found in close proximity, the presence of microblade and microlith production debitage, microburins, and the lack of finished tools suggested that this scatter was representative of the reduction of cores prepared elsewhere, possibly in a single event. The area of the flint scatter was at least 13m&amp;#178; and probably extended beyond the trench limits, but as only a limited area around the scatter was exposed it is difficult to be certain of the extent of this Mesolithic activity. It should be noted however that a preserved and extensive in situ lithic scatter of early prehistoric date could be considered to be of exceptional interest and warrant protection as a heritage asset of national importance.   </value>

The centre of the site lies at National Grid reference 534500,180563.     A Holocene sequence (mainly consisting of soft clays lying over peat and then sandy silt atop the Pleistocene gravel) was recorded and sampled in Trench 5 and also as part of the previous borehole assessment undertaken on the site. The basal organic sequence had been previously radiocarbon dated to the late Neolithic and mid Bronze Age. The sequence is overlain by apparent post medieval (likely Georgian) made ground related to dock construction. Sands and gravels encountered from -2.02m OD are part of the Shepperton gravel and rise towards the north east to the Taplow terrace. The overlying deposits provided a record of landscape change particularly through the late Neolithic and Bronze Age periods when a wooded marsh developed over the gravel floodplain, which had remained high and dry throughout the Mesolithic. Although no direct evidence was found on the site of human occupation, there was indirect evidence particularly through pollen assessment of woodland clearance and agricultural activity locally during this period and probably on the higher terrace to the north of the site.  </value>

A total of 24ha was stripped revealing archaeology dating from the Mesolithic through to the Middle Iron Age with the main focus being dispersed pits of Bronze Age date. The earliest feature on site was a springhead complex with significant pollen sequences demonstrating the changing environment from the Early Mesolithic through to the Neolithic. The two main periods of activity identified dated to the Early and Middle Bronze Age, with the Early Bronze Age characterised by pits and cremations dispersed across the excavation area and the Middle Bronze Age consisting of a small settlement. The Iron Age archaeology comprised several watering holes. A common feature across all of the main phases was the presence of impressive water logged wood assemblages.   </value>

Across the site, several natural hollows were encountered, showing preserved buried dry land soils containing evidence of Mesolithic and Early Neolithic activity.   A Bronze Age ring ditch was exposed in three trenches. In the east of the site a field system and associated features of probable Middle Bronze Age date were recorded, with elements of another to the southeast.  At the northern corner of the site, a depression or hollow of prehistoric date was found to have a metalled surface at its base: possible ground stabilisation around a pool or well.  From the Roman period, a single possible beam slot was excavated while a number of residual finds came from later features. A probable Roman ditch was also uncovered below what may be a medieval headland running north-south in the centre of site.  A disused trackway, possibly part of the Roman route, Ashwell Street, running east-west across the middle of the site was found to have stark variations in its depth and form, including a section of hollow way close to New Road. This track forms the basis of the Medieval ridge and furrow system across the west and south of the area.

The HER records a total of nine sites of archaeological interest nearby, including a possible Neolithic settlement recorded during an archaeological evaluation carried out in advance of the construction of the new housing estate, a Bronze Age axe, a net sinker of uncertain age, and a number of remains of post-medieval date. In addition, a crop mark of uncertain date and a potentially interesting place-name were revealed in documentary sources during the desk-based assessment and two small areas of probable quarrying were revealed during the site visit. It is considered that, although the two sites of known archaeological interest identified within the proposed development area are of low significance, the site has some potential for previously unknown archaeological remains to be present. More specifically the work carried out in the adjoining field, which identified finds and features of Neolithic and possibly Mesolithic date, and other evidence of prehistoric and perhaps early medieval activity from the wider area demonstrate that there is potential for remains from these periods to be present within the proposed development area.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation carried out on land adjacent to the River Dove off of Cranley Hall Road, immediately to the south of Eye, Suffolk, did not identify any firm evidence for past activity on the site prior to the 20th century, suggesting that the site has historically been subject to only a low-level of use, most likely as floodplain meadowland for animal grazing.    However the trench stratigraphy demonstrated that the site contains palaeo-environment deposits, with a natural sequence of thick and relatively uniform peat layers. Radiocarbon dating has shown that these were laid down from the Late Mesolithic to the Late Anglo-Saxon period.     Palaeo-enviromental analysis of a monolith column sample of the peat has shown that the preservation of environmental remains was variable. Although further study is not recommended, it was noted that the data could form an important starting point for future investigation of the Dove valley as part of a comparative dataset.     Therefore although the development will involve substantial groundworks these will only have a localised and so relatively minor impact upon deposits which have been characterised and are likely to extend across the remainder of the field and into the broader floodplain.  </value>

Remains included a possible oven or kiln, evidence of ironworking and crop processing, plus an important assemblage of pottery including several previously unrecognised forms within the county. The latter were associated with fabrics not normally associated with such forms and it is suggested on the balance of evidence that at least some elements of the activity present may date to the very end of the Bronze Age or Early Iron Age period.  A general scatter of Roman, medieval, post-medieval and modern material found across the site was determined to be the result of incidental distribution during agricultural manuring of agricultural fields. There was no evidence for the continuation of the Roman site previously identified to the north.   Within Area 11, to the south, a deep peat deposit was recorded, and determined by radiocarbon dating to have been forming from the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic (4690-4450 cal BC) through to the Early Bronze Age (2290-1910 cal BC). It is conjectured to be part of a large palaeochannel, possibly an earlier course of the River Severn, which now flows to the east.

An archaeological evaluation of the site in 2012 revealed two areas of activity; at the north-western corner, and within the south-eastern quadrant, where evidence of burnt agricultural features and timber structures featured in the latter. The results suggested that the site lay within Holdingham's hinterland and, prior to the medieval period, focused on subsistence farming.   Subsequent to evaluation, PCAS Ltd. was commissioned to undertake a scheme of archaeological mitigation works on the proposed development site to ensure the effective preservation by record of the site's archaeological resource.  Excavation exposed a limited number of archaeological features, the majority of which were of likely agricultural origin, dating from the medieval and post-medieval periods. Also exposed was a relatively large penannular ditch, probably a roundhouse, dated to within the middle to late Iron Age. This roundhouse appears to have been relatively isolated in the landscape, perhaps reflecting the importance of its former occupants.

<value columnNumber="1">The recent works, which included the stripping of interior finishes, internal alterations and the creation of new door and window openings revealed the construction of the first floor exterior walls, which were previously largely obscured by interior plaster finishes and  exterior tile-hanging.  The construction comprises small-panel timber-framing, with some footbraces, which were seemingly confined to the service end of the building.  The location of two original mullioned windows was identified, to the front and rear elevations.    The original infill to the first floor timber frame, which is likely to have been lath and daub, was replaced with brickwork, probably during the 19th century when the ground floor was rebuilt in brick; it seems probable this was carried out with the intention of it being obscured by tile-hanging.      The watching brief on the groundworks at the site resulted in the recovery of material dating between the Mesolithic/Neolithic periods and the twentieth century. The presence of prehistoric flintwork is indicative of casual loss during transient activity, ether at, or in the vicinity of the site, while recovered sherds of medieval pottery are presumed to be the result of manuring of the local fields. A large collection of 19th and 20th century material is clearly more directly 'domestic' in origin, from the dumping of detritus close to the cottage. Finds from a midden deposit included pottery, tile, glass, clay tobacco pipe and metalwork.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents an initial account of the results of an archaeological mitigation on the main works at King George's Park on behalf of Tideway.  This included a geoarchaeological evaluation trench across CSO Shaft and Cofferdam area, alongside a watching brief on areas outside of the trench.  The site is situated on the north-eastern corner of King George's Park, in Wandsworth Town, on the south side of the river Thames.  The results show the existence of a channel incised down to a minimum of -0.42m OD in the surface of the London Clay Formation bedrock. The channel was filled by a complex sequence of naturally accumulated alluvial sediments, comprising gravels, sands, silts, clays, peats and tufas up to 3.00m OD. The sequence across the site was then sealed by redeposited alluvium, post-medieval garden soil deposits and modern made ground.  Due to the fluvial nature of the deposits encountered at the site, no archaeological remains were found. However, the complex sedimentary sequence encountered at the site records a detailed sequence of palaeoenvironmental information relating to the late Pleistocene and Holocene evolution of the River Wandle. The various phases of sedimentation at the site reflect the development of the river from a high-energy braided river during the Upper Palaeolithic, its evolution into a meandering stream, then a low-energy anastomosing river forming complex peat and tufa strata probably dating to the Mesolithic period, and finally an extensively human-modified river in the post-medieval period.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An evaluation recorded later prehistoric (Bronze Age - Iron Age) features, the most significant of which was a large rectilinear enclosure demarcated by substantial ditches, located on a slight plateau in the west of the site.  The upper fills of the enclosure ditches contained Late Bronze Age/ Early Iron Age settlement debris, but this is likely to derive from a secondary phase of settlement, the ditches having been open and filling-in for some time before this was deposited.  A Middle Bronze Age date is suggested for the enclosure's original construction, based partly on morphological parallels with a similar enclosure at Ormesby St Michael.  A curvilinear ditch inside the enclosure had the appearance of a roundhouse eaves-drip gully, probably associated with the phase of Late Bronze Age/ Early Iron Age occupation.  Other undated, but possibly prehistoric, ditches were identified nearby.      On the sloping ground in the central and eastern part of the site was an area of dispersed later prehistoric features including field boundary ditches, a water-hole, and a pit containing part of a Late Bronze Age/ Iron Age pottery vessel.  This area can be characterised as the agricultural 'infield' of the settlement.  Concentrations of Mesolithic and Neolithic struck flint, and some Early Bronze Age pottery, were found residually in features in Trench 12 and indicate a focus of earlier prehistoric activity on the lower ground in the east of the site.

The earlier  Bronze Age was represented by a near-complete Bronze Age cordoned urn dated to the first  half of the 2nd millennium BC but was not obviously associated with a cremation burial as  expected. Most of the features excavated, however, date to the late Iron Age and early Roman  periods, and include ditches and pits early in this period, with stone-built structures appearing  in the 2nd century AD and lasting into the 3rd. The material culture disposed of by the  inhabitants is probably sufficient to indicate that this was part of a villa complex, possibly  including a shrine or temple, though evidence for the latter is circumstantial.

The earliest features comprise a scattering of shallow pits and probable tree holes from which Mesolithic or early Neolithic struck flint and Neolithic pottery was recovered.  The most significant findings are likely to belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age and consisted of a cremation cemetery.    The Roman period is primarily represented by a possible ditched field system, although the evidence was generally quite sparse however, suggesting Roman occupation was limited and that the finds may be residual material in later features.  The Saxon period is primarily represented by two large pits and by finds from a large shallow depression towards the east end of the development area.  A single L-shaped ditched enclosure at the north-west corner of the site is the only feature of medieval date.  The function of the enclosed space is unclear; however an agricultural use seems likely.    The post-medieval period is represented by an agricultural field system aligned with the extant field boundaries on site; some of the ditches revealed during the excavation appear to be depicted on the 1841 tithe map of the area and align with observed crop-marks.  </value>

Prehistoric activity on the site was limited with occasional residual Mesolithic and Neolithic flint finds and a group of small pits dated by their pottery to the Early Iron Age. A large assemblage of Roman pottery dating from the mid first to the late second early third centuries was produced by a series of pits and ditches. A small amount of Roman CBM was recovered from the ditches but although postholes of a similar date were revealed no Roman buildings could be defined.    Only a single ditch terminus in the south of the site represented the medieval period. The north of the site was bounded by two Post-Medieval ditches which demarcated a field boundary shown on the First Edition Ordnance Survey of 1885.

The scheme is a continuation of previous work carried out at Ash Green Lane in January 2016 (BAL 2016).  Although no archaeological features were present, the finds recovered suggested activity in the area from the Mesolithic or early Neolithic, through the Romano-British and medieval to the post-medieval periods. However, no evidence for occupation, with the exception of post-medieval building rubble from Fields 1, 2, 3 and 6, was identified.  The late medieval pottery recovered from the topsoil/subsoil interface in Field 1 may derive from a pottery manufacturing centre identified in 1969 some 400m W of the pipeline route. The wide scatter of material may suggest that a number of small kilns were present, utilising the marginal wooded conditions known to have existed in this area during the medieval period.

<value columnNumber="1">In July-August, Cotswold Archaeology carried out a programme of archaeological mitigation work during the installation of a new cable run for the proposed West Raynham Solar Park, Norfolk.  The work comprised both a watching brief and a narrow strip, map and sample investigation along the line of the cable run.    Several archaeological features were recorded, the majority of which were ditches. Features were generally shallow with single fills only. Dating evidence was scarce, but a small number of  features were Late Bronze Age to Roman in date. A limited number of medieval furrows were also recorded, and there were several post-medieval features, some of which related to the 17th-century  Raynham Park.    The limited width of the stripped area meant that it was difficult to interpret the archaeological features and place them in their wider contexts. Features were generally scattered along the route, with few close relationships.    It is concluded that the landscape in the area of the cable run was exploited in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, but this exploitation was not intensive. There was also residual lithic evidence for earlier activity spanning the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age.    The cable run was tunnelled beneath a road preserving the line of a known Roman thoroughfare. No associated roadside ditches or structures were exposed. There was no evidence for a postulated second Roman road crossing the cable run, indicating either that this road does not exist, or it has been completely removed by later activity.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological trial-trench evaluation was undertaken as part of a planning condition prior to the construction of 32 residential houses. The main objective of the investigation was to locate and date a track known to run through the site toward the River Blackwater from Maldon Road.    The track was located and can be demonstrated to be modern (its surfacing material contained tarmac). The finds from a boundary ditch, known from historic mapping to cross the site, date it to the 19th century. One post-medieval post-hole was also recorded. A modern cobbled surface, occurring just below the turf line, and a pit are likely to be related to the recent use of the site as a market venue, while a drainage pipe and gully represent general modern landscape management.    The evaluation also revealed residual evidence of Mesolithic flint-knapping at this location. A Mesolithic microlithic flint core and two flakes were found in the same context as one sherd of undiagnostic prehistoric pottery and a non-prehistoric flint, within an apparently natural feature. This prehistoric evidence is of limited archaeological significance due to its residual nature within a single natural feature, though it shows that Mesolithic activity in the Brain Valley was not restricted to the Ivy Chimneys and Chipping Hill sites in Witham.  </value>

The surface of the Pleistocene\Early Holocene deposits indicated a series of braided river channels within a low-lying area on the western margins of a main channel. A borehole survey showed this channel to be over 200m wide and c.3m deep. This feature would have formed a major part of the floodplain landscape from the Early Holocene and probably became a major drainage feature when the other Holocene channels to the west became abandoned. It is possible that the channel forms an abandoned arm of a former course of the Great Breach Dyke, which existed from the Early Holocene period into the Bronze Age. A Mesolithic land surface was identified with rising sea levels leading to widespread peat formation by the early Neolithic into the Bronze Age, Within the peat deposits were worked timbers which may have formed parts of a structure, possibly a trackway constructed to access or traverse the wetlands. The overlying alluvial silts and clays are likely to be of Iron Age, medieval and historic date representing an inundation of the floodplain.

Fieldwalking has recovered prehistoric flints dating from the Late Mesolithic to Early Bronze Age from land at New Farm to the southeast of the proposed development area.  The objective of the geophysical surveys was to determine the presence/absence, nature and extent of potential archaeological features within the study area, and the presence/absence of any known modern features within the survey area, which may affect the results.   Several former field boundaries and former ponds were detected, which are depicted on the Morton Tithe Map of 1839 and the 1st Edition Ordnance Survey map of 1847 and later maps. The ponds were backfilled in the late 20th century, and the field boundaries removed to create larger fields.

The Evaluation involved the monitoring of purposive geoarchaeological boreholes, which confirmed that deposits of palaeo-environmental interest exist between about 3m OD and -3m OD. The purpose of the evaluation was to obtain geoarchaeological records and samples for off-site examination. Deposit modelling and the integration of specialist palaeo-environmental data shows that at the base of the Holocene deposits lies the Late Devensian Glacial formation of the Shepperton Gravels. These are overlain by Early Holocene banked sands that stabilised to form short lived Mesolithic landsurfaces. Silty clays and peats mark the inundation affects of relative sea level rise from the Early Neolithic to the Bronze Age. Towards the west these dense wooded environments were predominantly freshwater but became slightly brackish to the east of the route with the onset of tidal access. From the Iron Age onwards silty clays dominate as grass and herb fen mudflats form and brackish marine conditions move westwards and a full estuary environment is indicated to the east.

<value columnNumber="1">Although there was a presence on the site as early as the Mesolithic, the earliest definable activity dated to the later Neolithic period and was characterised by two parallel, linear ditches that ran on an approximate ENE - WSW alignment. This was followed in the Middle Bronze Age by the construction of a sub-circular, segmented enclosure, with a number of contemporary features also being present. A subsequent phase of activity during the early part of the Late Bronze Age, saw the creation of a large, rectangular double-ditched enclosure, with a number of associated features suggesting possible occupation. Later prehistoric activity was also detected. Although residual Roman finds were recovered there was not significant further activity on the site until it was re-occupied at about the time of the Norman Conquest. Ditches were excavated and a number of timber structures, possibly domestic dwellings, were built. In the mid 13th century the emphasis of activity on site appears to have shifted from domestic to agricultural and it is possible that a farm was created here at this time. Occupation of the site continued into the post-medieval period, with the archaeological evidence suggesting a number of phases of activity up until the 19th century. Historic maps from this period onwards show the site occupied by a farmyard and buildings, which may have originated in the medieval period. The archaeological investigations recorded structural remains from the later phases of farm occupation up to demolition of the farm and its replacement with a garage complex in the mid 20th century.</value>

Archaeological works were required as a condition of planning permission by Cornwall Council for the cut, fill and re-grade of an existing field to form an extension to Mylor Harbour's boat park, together with new boat parking spaces, surfacing, perimeter fencing and gates. Features of archaeological interest were exposed across the area. These comprised 94 probable pit features of which 24 were excavated with the remainder preserved in situ. Also revealed was a pattern of field boundaries forming small sub-square fields of medieval date. An assemblage of Grooved Ware pottery of Late Neolithic date adds to a small corpus of sites in Cornwall with similar finds, with small numbers of pottery of Middle Bronze Age and Late Iron Age date and worked flint indicating that the site was the focus of undefined activity for a long period beginning in the Mesolithic period.  </value>

However significant limitations were placed on the evaluation. Nevertheless an 8% (15,115 linear metres) sample of the available areas was investigated by the evaluation.    Though the majority of the development site had been truncated by modern farming and industrial operations, significant archaeological remains were recorded within the development (Area A). These consisted of several walls, pits and linear ditches relating to the post medieval settlement of Newton as shown on the Roy map of 1747-1755. Structural elements of Newton House dating to the late 18th century and 19th century were also recorded. The features produced a small assemblage of Scottish reduced ware, iron slag, and 18th and 19th century ceramics.    Three lithic artefacts of Mesolithic date including a quartz thumbnail scraper and flint blade core were recovered from the topsoil.   </value>

(NGR 541560 101310). Three trenches were mechanically excavated to a cumulative length of 43m.    Although there was a paucity of closely datable material, the orientation of one gully suggests it formed the continuation of one of a system of features forming Middle Iron Age droveways recorded on other sites in the locale. The ditch contained a small amount of Mesolithic or Neolithic worked flint thought therefore to be residual.     The orientation of another gully/ditch suggests a post-medieval date, again based on the alignment of features encountered at other nearby sites in recent years.    An otherwise undated post-hole, pit and ?spread may also belong to the Middle Iron Age, or variously to earlier or later periods.

<value columnNumber="1">In accordance with the Written Scheme of Investigation (MOLA 2017), nine geoarchaeological augerholes were undertaken across the site to retrieve the full sequence of sediments existing on the site to a depth unobtainable through trenching. The sampling took the form of terrier rig auger samples (AH1-9).    The results of the work outlined in this evaluation and deposit model report showed that the site was heavily truncated probably by the construction (and destruction) of the Railway complex andpossibly later construction work. However, sediments were recovered considered to be representative of the wider floodplain of the River Witham / Brayford Pool area with Pleistocene sands  topped by peat and alluvium buried beneath deep sequences of made ground. The model of the early Holocene or Mesolithic topography indicates the eastern, western and southern  fringes of the site occupies relatively high ground (largely truncated) surrounding a pocket of lower ground in the central northern area of the site where peats and alluvial material developed during the later Holocene (Late Bronze Age).    The initial work carried out on the augerholes from SMAL17 indicates potential to provide a record of landscape change from the Late Bronze Age possibly through to the medieval / post medieval  period which can integrate the site with models and other site data from the area. Although no direct evidence was found on the site of human occupation, indirect evidence of human activity around the site is likely to be retained in microfossil data within the deposits.   </value>

The potential for the development of a landscape characterization project (archaeology) at Dartington was highlighted to Dr Malcolm Lillie by Mr. Tom Gloynes, who initially sent images of finds, and subsequently brought a significant number of both unworked and worked stone objects to Hull University between September and October of 2012. In November of 2012 Peter Makey, a local flint specialist based in Yorkshire, undertook a preliminary assessment of the finds from the Hill Park field at Dartington.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology, on behalf of Bloor Homes Ltd, between June and July 2015 on Land North of Roman Way, Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, in advance of residential development.   Remains were found in the northern part of the site (Area 1), the earliest comprising an arc of postholes located along the eastern edge of a small gravel island on the clay valley floor between the Rivers Eye/Dikler and Windrush. Radiocarbon dating demonstrated that these dated to the second half of the 9th millennium BC (the Early Mesolithic).   A few sherds of Neolithic pottery were recovered from the site, but most remains were of a Middle Bronze Age cemetery focussed on the western edge of the gravel island. The cemetery seems to have been exposed in its entirety and comprised the inhumations of two adult women and the cremated remains of a further ten unsexed individuals, comprising eight adults and two non adults. Radiocarbon dating placed these burials within the middle to late second millennium BC (the Middle Bronze Age). The burials were concentrated across an area 29m in diameter and may have been covered by a barrow, of which no traces survived, but were more probably within a flat cemetery. The investigation also examined a possible continuation of the Iron Age ramparts of Salmonsbury Camp into the southern part of the site (Area 2) but showed that no such continuation was present. Iron Age remains were restricted to an abraded pottery sherd within a palaeochannel and a second abraded sherd within a posthole found within the area of the Middle Bronze Age cemetery. Later remains related to the site's location within the agricultural hinterland of Bourton-on-the-Water from the medieval period onwards.  </value>

A desk-based assessment was undertaken in May 2012 which concluded that the site appears to lie within an area of high archaeological potential. A geophysical (magnetometer) survey of the site was conducted in November 2012 and revealed numerous anomalies across the site, interpreted as buried archaeological remains.  Based on results obtained from the desk-based assessment and the geophysical results, ten trial trenches were excavated which targeted areas of geophysical features along with areas of unknown archaeological potential. Of those trenches that were excavated, eight produced evidence of archaeological features and deposits. Over twenty archaeological features were excavated mainly comprising of ditches and pits, also recorded was a formation of deposits known as 'buried soil' or 'dark earth'.  The earliest find recovered during the evaluation was a flint blade core from an unstratified deposit. This type of artefact is characteristic of later Mesolithic to earlier Neolithic blade production in East Anglia.   The majority of archaeological features and deposits have been attributed to the Romano-British period with a number of artefacts indicating predominately 2nd-century AD Roman occupation. With the exception of a few unstratified finds there was little evidence to suggest that occupation of the site continued beyond the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD. The presence of buried soils or dark earth may be evidence for deliberate dumping episodes and prolonged periods of settlement abandonment or may be a result of the sites marginal location in relation to more preferable </value>

Late Upper Palaeolithic material underwent some one to two thousand years of biological reworking, whereas most of the Early Mesolithic artefacts were little affected by biological turbation before being buried by alluvium.

The sequence concluded in the later Iron Age, when, apart from a small farmstead enclosure, the ridge then saw an extraordinary range of ritual activity along its northern flank. Focusing upon a riverside 'midden'/platform (including dismembered horse carcasses), this involved disarticulated human remains and small votive 'packages' (e.g. variously clutches of weaving combs and brooches).

<value columnNumber="1">The watching brief on the Plumstead Sidings boreholes supplements the previous evaluation and deposit model. The borehole and trench evidence records floodplain gravels and sands overlain by peats and alluvial clays. The surface of the Pleistocene/Early Holocene deposits indicated a series of braided river channels within a low lying area on the western margins of a main channel. A borehole survey showed this channel to be over 200m wide and c.3m deep. This feature would have formed a major part of the floodplain landscape from the Early Holocene and probably became a major drainage feature when the other Early Holocene channels identified to the west became abandoned. It is possible that the channel forms an abandoned arm of a former course of the Great Breach Dyke, which existed from the Early Holocene into the Bronze Age period. The Plumstead Sidings watching brief has confirmed a north to south route of this former channel and provides a more detailed record of the physical characteristics of this channel including possible meanders and secondary routes.     A Mesolithic land surface was identified during the evaluation but rising sea levels leading to widespread peat formation by the Early Neolithic into the Bronze Age. Within the peat deposits were worked timbers which may have formed parts of a structure, possibly a trackway constructed to access or traverse the wetlands. The overlying alluvial silts and clays are likely to be of Iron Age, medieval and historic date representing an inundation of the floodplain.     The upper 1.20m comprised dumps which represent making up and levelling of the site prior to the construction of the railway and associated buildings in the vicinity.

The Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic/Early Bronze Age periods were represented by solely by residual flint flakes. A rare Neolithic/Early Bronze Age polished flint chisel was part of the assemblage.    The Middle Bronze Age was the first period identified with evidence for permanent activity and for an organised landscape. The main elements, ring-ditch, the seven cremations, and field boundary ditch suggest a relatively open pastoral/arable landscape punctuated with burials and burial monuments.     The Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age period was the dominant period of activity represented on the site with a settlement or the fringes of settlement developing on the western hill-crest in the main excavation area. Like the earlier period the landscape is still predominantly agricultural with a droveway and field boundary ditches but studded with numerous waste and grain storage pits, post-built structures/building and a metalled hollow way.    The Middle Iron Age saw a reduction of activity on the site with the main features of a circular enclosure in the west and along the southern site boundary grain-storage pits, post-structures and waste pits.    No Late Iron Age features or activity was found on this site which considering the amount of LIA archaeology found elsewhere is surprising.

The site lies outside of the historic town of Knutsford, there are no Scheduled Monuments,  Listed Buildings, Registered Battlefields or Registered Parks and Gardens within the site  boundary.  The wider study area shows evidence of multiphase activity, specifically within the  Registered Parks and Gardens of Tatton Park (DCH1474) to the north and west of the  site, where there is evidence from the Mesolithic to modern day. To the south is a Medieval  Scheduled Monument of St Johns Church and Burial Ground (DCH450), to the east is a  17th century Grade II listed Hall with associated buildings and also to the south an area of  18th century Industrial activity.  The site sits between the two conservation areas of Knutsford and Mobberley centres, it is  also northeast of Knutsford Area of Archaeological Importance.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">153 trenches were excavated in two blocks, following a geophysical survey which showed little  obviously significant archaeology. Traces of ridge-and-furrow (the result of long-term medieval/  post-medieval 'open field' agriculture) were apparent on the geophysical survey throughout the  evaluation area, but do not survive as earthworks.     Prehistoric features include a possible human cremation burial in Trench 132 (containing 22g of  burnt human bone) associated with four worked flints consistent with a Late Mesolithic or Early  Neolithic date. The cremation deposit was dominated by charcoal with a few poorly preserved  charred cereal grains present. A single sherd of Middle Neolithic Peterborough ware pottery was  recovered from a ditch in the adjacent Trench 129. The results from Trenches 129 and 132,  taken together, suggest that south-eastern field may contain an ephemeral Neolithic funerary  site.  A single N-S aligned Roman ditch in Trenches 112 and 114, and a small pit with a charcoal-rich  fill in Trench 118 were the only probable Roman features encountered, which are tentatively  dated on the basis of four sherds of pottery from four separate contexts. N Later medieval / post-medieval features include a single 14th-15th  century rubbish pit in Trench 130, and several former field boundary ditches. A small group of  hearths in Trench 48 has no associated dating evidence.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeological observation was undertaken on behalf of Bristol Water plc between 6th August and 4th December 2012 of open-cut trenching excavations for the insertion of a new water main between Herd Lane, on the eastern side of Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and a covered reservoir located to the north of the town on Blind Lane. The ground works represented Phase IV of the Shipton Moyne to Tetbury Mains Renewal scheme. Three areas of archaeological potential were identified as being affected by this phase of engineering works and were thus subject to archaeological monitoring, these being the open land to the north of Tetbury Industrial Estate, currently scheduled to become Quercus Park; fields to the south and west of Highfield Farm where Roman and prehistoric features were identified during previous trial-trenching, and the section of pipeline crossing playing fields at Sir William Romney Secondary School. The route through Quercus Park followed the line of a previously installed storm drain. Although the southern part of this redevelopment land had been deemed of high archaeological potential, much of the northern part had been disturbed during installation of the sewer or during previous archaeological investigations. However, an undisturbed area of subsoil in which worked flints of later Mesolithic date (c. 7500-4000 BC) were found, was identified in Quercus Park. At Highfield Farm, where recent trial-trenching had uncovered remains of late prehistoric or early Roman date, the ground works did not encounter any significant archaeological finds and it may be the case that this area lay outside the main focus of archaeological activity. No finds of archaeological significance were present in the excavations across the school playing field, which appeared to have been levelled and landscaped in the recent past.</value>

The pit contained three conjoining sherds of pottery dating to the Romano British period. Two residual lithics were also recovered from the pit dating to the Mesolithic - Early Neolithic period. No further archaeological features were exposed. In the east of the evaluation area, trenching revealed considerably disturbance due to open cast quarrying. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeological Research Services Ltd was commissioned by Hope Construction Materials Ltd to undertake a programme of archaeological evaluation trenching on the site of the proposed redevelopment of the present Freightliner Rail Services scrapyard site at Dagenham Dock Station in London. The site had previously been the subject of a desk based assessment (Eadie 2014) and geoarchaeological coring with subsequent assessment of pollen and plant macrofossils (Howard and McLellan 2015). Two archaeological evaluation trenches were mechanically excavated under archaeological supervision. A stratigraphic sequence was excavated through the made ground, alluvial deposits and peat to the underlying Late Glacial Shepperton Gravels. No archaeological remains were encountered during the evaluation trenching. Well-preserved palaeoenvironmental remains were present, as implied by the borehole results, and well-preserved timbers were encountered within the peat and include remains of yew and oak.    A detailed palaeoenvironmental assessment was undertaken on a sediment borehole. Pollen and botanical macrofossils were analysed, samples were taken from diatom and invertebrate remains however poor preservation prevented further analysis of these remains. A sequence of radiocarbon dates was obtained, the sediments date from the Late Mesolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The pollen and botanical macrofossil sequence records a Neolithic alder carr environment with an unusual presence of yew trees. During the Bronze Age the environment transitioned to a much drier and more open meadow and mixed woodland environment.</value>

This fieldwork comprised the excavation of an iron working site, identified during a prior archaeological evaluation. This site comprised a bowl furnace and associated ore-quarry, with evidence of limited on-site primary smithing, which has been radiocarbon dated to the Middle Iron Age. The bloomery was sealed by a layer of colluvium, which had likely formed by the Late Iron Age. Evidence of low-level agricultural activity was recorded for the 13th and 18th to earlier 19th centuries. A small residual lithic assemblage indicated low-level Late Mesolithic/ Early Neolithic to Middle Bronze Age activity in the vicinity of the site. </value>

The site occupies a triangular parcel of land at the junction between Pearl Lane (the B4194)  and Areley Common (the B4196), from which no archaeological activity has yet been  recorded. Nevertheless, excavations in the immediate vicinity reveal the site to lie within a complex prehistoric landscape utilised from the Mesolithic to the Romano-British period. A  palaeochannel marks the course of a small stream which once flowed across the site from its  source in the north-east corner towards a pool at Longmore Hill Farm, the nearby site of a  finds-rich late Neolithic pit. This stream follows a valley between rolling hills upon which a  Bronze Age round barrow, and Iron Age and Romano-British settlement and enclosure have  been identified and excavated. The stream is thought likely to have attracted activity from  these communities, each of which may have left its mark in the archaeological record.    Whilst Redstone Road to the north, and the B4194, are known to have been important roads  during the medieval period, no associated archaeological evidence is expected within the  study site as the settlement focus and medieval priory were located some distance away at  Astley. The site lay within a larger common field system during the medieval and post  medieval periods, enclosed only in 1811 by a Parliamentary Act. Since this time, the site has  been subject to arable farming which is thought to have had minimal impact upon the  potential underlying archaeology.</value>

In accordance with the Written Scheme of Investigation (MOLA 2015), geoarchaeological augerholes were undertaken across the site to retrieve the full sequence of sediments existing on the site to a depth unobtainable through trenching. The sampling took the form of terrier rig auger samples (AH1 to 5).    The results of the evaluation showed that the site lies within the wider floodplain of the Thames with a sands, and silts underlying bands of peat lying under historic alluvial deposits which in turn are buried beneath made ground deposits. The model of the early Holocene or Mesolithic topography indicates a channel environment within undulating gravel deposits typical of the floodplain environment.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Outline planning permission (N6/2006/923/OP) was granted for a sports hall, all weather sports pitch and associated facilities at Sir Frederic Osborn School in Welwyn Garden City.  As the development lies within an area of archaeological sensitivity, a condition (Condition 10) was attached to the planning consent requiring the implementation of a programme of archaeological work.  This was in accordance with Policy R29 of the Welwyn Hatfield District Plan (2005).    Construction work on the site began without discharge of Condition 10.  As a result, the Historic Environment Advisor for Hertfordshire County Council (HEA) advised that all groundworks should cease until a programme of archaeological work had been carried out.  In order to confirm the archaeological potential of the site and identify which heritage assets (if any) might have been damaged, the HEA indicated that the first phase of work should include an assessment of the impact of the development so far and a trial trench evaluation of the site.      Trial trenching took place on the 20th and 25th June, and comprised the excavation of five trenches located within areas that had suffered least disturbance from construction-related activities.      Two flint artefacts dating to between the Mesolithic and early Neolithic periods were recovered from the subsoil within Trench 1.  Their location in the subsoil, and a lack of any other contemporary finds or features, suggests that at best they can only be considered to be an indication of activity of these periods in the wider area.      The only archaeological feature revealed was a small pit located within Trench 3 which appears to represent the base of a hearth.  A very small sherd of abraded pottery suggests it dates to the late Iron Age.      </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation was undertaken across approximately 4.4ha of land at Truman's  Farm on the eastern edge of Gotherington, Gloucestershire (centred on NGR SO 97104 29638). It  was undertaken on behalf of Lioncourt Strategic Land, with the site under consideration for  residential development.  Sixteen trenches of varying length were excavated in a broad array across the site, which was  known from a preceding heritage assessment and geophysical survey to have buried ridge and  furrow agricultural remains of probable medieval date.  Across the trenches the archaeological remains observed confirmed that this site occupies an area  of land previously used for mostly rural agricultural activity, with no indication of direct settlement  due to the lack of features and the relative absence of cultural material remains from any period.  The medieval and later pottery finds, found across the trenches, are likely to relate to this  agriculture. The presence of a small amount of worked flint of a possible later Mesolithic/early  Neolithic date is of interest, especially given the location of the site at the edge of an advantageous  topographical position, suggesting that there may be a background scatter of prehistoric activity  across the wider area.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Oxford Archaeology East conducted a Strip, Map  and  Record and Trench Evaluation at land adjacent to Hadleigh Road, 800m north of the village of Semer, Suffolk (Phase 1). Archaeological investigation in this phase concentrated on the test pitting and recording of naturally deposited sands and silts. Many of these deposits contained struck flint flakes dating from the Mesolithic to Iron Age periods, as well as Neolithic pottery. A report for Phase 1 has been produced (Jarosz-Blackburn 2015).  Oxford Archaeology East returned to the site for Anglian Water between 9th and 13th April 2015 for Phase 2, a further trench evaluation of a strip of land south-east of the original pipeline location, prior to the construction of a Water Treatment Works. After the topsoil had been stripped, two trenches totalling 136m2 were excavated through the subsoil. In this area, the natural silty deposits containing worked flints were not present, however quarry pitting dating from the late Medieval to post-Medieval periods was uncovered and investigated. This activity is may relate to road and pathway/surface construction, the quarrying being for large gravel and cobblestone extraction.  A walk-over survey of the subsoil was carried out to check for the presence of struck flints (as found further to the north during Phase 1), and none were found to be present within this area. However, a small number of residual flints were recovered from within the quarry pits.</value>

The works carried out comprised monitoring the excavations associated with a new access track at Teffont Substation, Teffont Evias, Wiltshire. They were centred on NGR 399850, 130950, as shown on Figure 1.  The proposed works for the new haul road were located in an area which is suspected to contain archaeological material associated with the Mesolithic period.  Although the access track was located within a potentially rich archaeological area, no in situ archaeological features or artefacts were identified during monitoring of the groundworks, although a possible flint core was recovered from the spoil heap associated with Area 1.   The absence of archaeological features recorded during the archaeological monitoring of the access track may be attributed to the location of the works within the margins of a previously ploughed field.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">ARS Ltd was commissioned to undertake a scheme of archaeological works on land in Bodicote, Oxfordshire in fulfilment of planning condition for a residential development. Preliminary DBA, Geophysics and Trial Trenching showed that the site had the potential for prehistoric remains and thus an open area excavation was planned to target high potential areas. The majority of the archaeological remains were encountered in Area 1 and Area 4, with no anthropogenic features encountered in Area 2 and only natural features and 19th century land drains encountered in Area 3.   The archaeological features in Area 1 predominantly dated to the Iron Age and comprised over 200 storage pits, 9 of which contained human burials. In addition, a series of enclosures, likely associated with animal husbandry were encountered. This activity area was demarcated by a large outer boundary ditch which marked the northern, western and southern limits of the Iron Age archaeology. A small number of small prehistoric pits were also encountered, some of which contained lithics, suggesting a potential Mesolithic/Neolithic date. A small number of LC19th-EC20th rubbish pits were encountered, most likely associated with allotments shown on historic mapping from this period.   In Area 4, a large ring ditch with 5 entrances and three smaller ring ditches were encountered. Flint recovered from some of the fills indicate a potential Neolithic or EBA date. A modest number of pits were encountered in this area, probably contemporary to the ring ditches. Three post medieval ditches were also excavated, which produced 19th century finds.  </value>

This evidence indicates human activity on the site during the Mesolithic to Early Neolithic and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age periods.  The primary result of the evaluation was the identification of a Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age field system formed by a series of NNE-SSW and ENE-WSW aligned ditches. The field system represented a continuation of the activity identified immediately north of the site, in an excavation conducted by ASE in 2014.Typically for landscape divisions from this period, artefactual evidence was limited to only a few sherds of very abraded pottery. The site provides an important addition to the growing, yet still sparse, evidence for Bronze Age field systems in Suffolk. Two pits and a possible posthole belonging to this period were also identified, however their exact function is difficult to ascertain.    The evaluation also identified a possible Prehistoric or Roman small enclosure ditch in Trench 57, the exact function of which is difficult to ascertain.

The majority of the proposed Site has been subject to little modern disturbance, and as such archaeological deposits are likely to be in a good state of preservation, although they may have been affected by arable farming techniques from the medieval and post-medieval periods.  The construction of the proposed solar modules, associated substations, inverter cabins, cable trenches and access track have the potential to have a Moderate/Large effect upon archaeological deposits.

<value columnNumber="1">Twelve trenches were excavated across the site which borders the eastern and south-eastern edges of the playing field. The earliest features and deposits were dated to the Middle Iron Age and are associated with the prehistoric settlement known in the playing field. The features uncovered include two drainage gullies and several pits distributed across the site area. Structural evidence came in the form of a concentration of postholes adjacent to two possible clay-lined storage pits. Although it was not possible to determine the type of structure or structures the postholes represent, associated finds of daub with wattle impressions, pottery and fragments of ceramic loomweights suggest buildings were located  on or near the site.   A second phase of Late Middle to Late Iron Age activity was represented by a large E-W drainage ditch in the south part of the site. This appears to have been necessitated by increasing flooding in the area, possibly from the nearby stream now known as the Beverley Brook, which deposited over 1.m of alluvial clays. A number of residual struck flints were recovered from these deposits including a long broad balde of triangular section which appears to be of Upper Palaeolithic type and two blades which may date to the early Mesolithic period Medieval activity was limited to a single pit and a series of furrows which might be associated with the known cultivation of osier in the 13th century.   A number of post-medieval garden and landscaping features in the south part of the site appear to be located within the grounds of the Barn Elms manor house.

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeology South-East were commissioned by Bovis Homes to carry out an archaeological excavation at land adjacent to Millfield, Southwater, West Sussex    The earliest activity is represented by three pits which are uncertainly dated but possibly attributable to the Mesolithic and/or Early Neolithic periods.    The most significant aspect of the archaeology is a settlement site dating to the 1st century AD. This activity seems to be largely of post-conquest date although there is possible evidence of Late Iron Age inception. A large space was enclosed by a natural stream or channel and associated drainage ditches, which may have defined an area of pasture or arable land. Within this, two small internal enclosures were initially established. Later, the two sets of ditches seem to have been modified into a single larger enclosure. This period of activity also produced possible evidence of a round-house and a large number of pits.    Some later Roman (c.late 2nd-3rd century) activity is also represented, although this is generally associated with less well-defined features, producing fewer finds. A series of pits with evidence of in situ burning have been provisionally assigned to this phase based on stratigraphic relationships but further scientific dating has been proposed to refine their chronology.    The remainder of the features are later field boundaries, one of which may also have served as a trackway. Some of the boundaries were almost certainly established by the 14th-15th century and perhaps as early as the late 12th-13th centuries. Much of this early field pattern survived until the 19th century.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">PCAS Archaeology Ltd (PCAS) was commissioned by Mr and Mrs Foxon, to undertake a scheme of archaeological mitigation on a plot of land known as Fair Field, to the north of Skegness Road, Partney, in the East Lindsey District of Lincolnshire (NGR: TF 41165 68345).  This work was undertaken to fulfil the terms of conditions attached to a planning application for the residential development of the site, based upon the results of an archaeological trail trench evaluation carried out in 2013.  Evidence for prehistoric activity was demonstrated with the collection of numerous worked flint artefacts, spanning the Mesolithic to Bronze Age. The earliest evidence for sustained activity consisted of pits and ditches dated to the Mid-Late Saxon period. Evidence of rare copper working during the Late Saxon/Saxo-Norman period, was recovered from one of the pits.  The identification of numerous and assorted building remains demonstrated that the site had been occupied post-Conquest and probably sub-divided into linear tenement plots with buildings being constructed along the street front and extending piecemeal into the back-plots. This provides previously unrecorded evidence of the Norman re-ordering of the site and subsequent development of the town.  Evidence for the abandonment of some early buildings and re-modelling of others records a general pattern of decline with perhaps the plots becoming vacant by the 17th century although with some opportunistic use after this time. This evidences the historically recorded decline of the town and may redefine Partney as a shrunken medieval town. The earliest evidence for maintaining livestock on the site was as late as the 18th century.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A cluster of residual Mesolithic flints was identified. The situation of the site next to a stream is typical Mesolithic behaviour.  Small amounts of residual Romano-British, Saxon and Saxo-Norman pottery were recovered. Alluvial events may have impacted the site around the Saxo-Norman period.  The pottery revealed a 12th/13th century date for most of the dateable features. Activity in this period was focused in the east of the site (although continuing across the whole area) and includes an area of heat-effected remains in the east end of Area 1. There appeared to be at least two foci of hot activity evidenced by heat-transformed deposits and the remains of a structure. A gully represents a boundary enclosing the heat-affected features. A contemporary (12th/13th century) metalled trackway continued to be used a boundary until at least the 15th century as evidenced by a ditch, wall and hedgerow. A boundary delineated by up to six iterations of ditches and gullies, some dating to the 12th/13th centuries, may also be significant.  The focus of activity appeared to shift to the middle of Area 2 in the 13th/14th centuries, with a series of ditches perhaps indicating an enclosure. An earlier 12th/13th-century posthole within this enclosure may represent a structure rebuilt in the 15th/16th centuries.  A range of finds including CBM and the structural features (eg building 361) suggest that the site represents settlement. The environmental evidence was consistent with crop processing and domestic waste, and the animal bone assemblage indicates that livestock species were being processed nearby.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of an archaeological excavation carried out by Archaeology South-East at Farrington Enterprise Estate, Peacehaven, West Sussex between May and June 2016. The fieldwork was commissioned by Clifford Dann in advance of the installation of industrial units, car park and associated groundworks.    The excavation revealed residual evidence of Mesolithic activity and subsequent Middle Neolithic flintwork and pottery within a tree bole. In addition to this, a concentration of Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age lithics was revealed, tentatively described as a flint scatter. Much of the stripped site was covered in a thin layer of colluvium which contained a mixed assemblage of lithics and pottery ranging from the Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, which masked a number of similarly dated tree boles. Several Neolithic to Bronze Age pits and a possible waterhole were also revealed on site.    Two Late Bronze Age pits were uncovered which yielded small assemblages of flint and pottery. Three Middle Iron Age pits were also observed cutting through the colluvium, which might relate to nearby excavations at Farrington Farm.     The relatively large assemblage of lithics recovered from the site, along with the possible flint scatter are of some local significance, providing further evidence of the use of the landscape during the Neolithic. The lithics from this site suggest a different pattern of flintworking to that observed at Brighton and Hove Wastewater Treatment Works and comparison of the two might provide greater insight into the use of the landscape during this time.</value>

The earliest artefacts  comprised a thin scatter of Mesolithic and Neolithic/Early Bronze Age flint, followed by a  small amount of Roman material. Significant Anglo-Saxon deposits were defined and, though  these were not productive of material culture, they did produce rich evidence for food  consumption and diet, including indications of high status. Minimal evidence for the period  of the medieval foundation of the priory and its operation was followed by substantial  assemblages of building materials associated with the Dissolution period, and particularly of  medieval floor tile which had probably been taken from the east end of the church.  Subsequent activity on the site was associated with continuous deposition of finds on the site  up to the 19th/20th century.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The aim of the investigations was to clarify the nature of the sub-surface stratigraphy across the site, the age of the Peat and its palaeoecological potential. This was achieved by putting down three boreholes, together with an assessment of the micro and macrofossil content  and  radiocarbon dating. The results indicate a sequence of Late Glacial Shepperton Gravel overlain Alluvial deposits and Peat. The Shepperton Gravel surface appears to undulate, resting between approximately 2.8 and 4.0m BGL. The Alluvial sediments resting on the Shepperton Gravel surface are indicative of deposition within slow to moderately fast moving water, semi-aquatic, and semi-terrestrial environments. Spatial and temporal variations between these environments are indicated by the complex distribution of the Alluvial sediments; these variations are fairly typical of a small floodplain valley. The deposits date from the early Mesolithic to early Bronze Age. Pollen and macrofossil remains were preserved in a moderate to good state of preservation. The assemblages suggest cold climatic conditions, with the growth of herbaceous taxa on the floodplain and nearby occurrence of pine and birch woodland, with a later transition to warmer mixed deciduous woodland. The assessment thus demonstrated that the organic-rich sediments preserved have good potential to provide a detailed reconstruction of past environments in the Darent Valley. Indeed, the results of the radiocarbon dating indicate a rare opportunity to reconstruct environments during the early Mesolithic cultural period. Unfortunately, however the potential for providing a detailed reconstruction of the environmental conditions on this particular site are substantially diminished due to the truncation of the Peat and poor retention of borehole core material and thus no further work is recommended. Nevertheless, the results of the assessment provide valuable information for future investigations within the local area. </value>

Planning permission has been sought from Vale of White Horse District Council for the erection of a farm building, apron and access. The application site is located within an area of considerable archaeological potential. Located on the south west corner of the proposed development is a circular feature, identified as a cropmark ring ditch. The eastern edge of this ring ditch was identified within the trench and sample excavated. Where excavated the form and depth of the ditch indicates that the feature is likely to be a round barrow rather than the ring ditch of a round house. The evaluation also identified a series of archaeological features extending to the east of the barrow. These included post holes, pits and ditches from which a number of artefacts were recovered, including pottery, flint and animal bone. One sherd of pottery was dated to the Late Iron Age while one flint flake was of possible Mesolithic or Late Neolithic date. The remains encountered therefore appear to represent activity dating from the Mesolithic or Neolithic, the Bronze Age and also the Iron Age. </value>

The earlier  Bronze Age was represented by a near-complete Bronze Age cordoned urn dated to the first  half of the 2nd millennium BC but was not obviously associated with a cremation burial as  expected. Most of the features excavated, however, date to the late Iron Age and early Roman  periods, and include ditches and pits early in this period, with stone-built structures appearing  in the 2nd century AD and lasting into the 3rd. The material culture disposed of by the  inhabitants is probably sufficient to indicate that this was part of a villa complex, possibly  including a shrine or temple, though evidence for the latter is circumstantial.

The work was undertaken ahead of the development of a new road on land to the north of the A47 at Postwick, Norfolk. Previous archaeological works at other sites associated with the proposed development have recorded prehistoric remains.  The evaluation consisted of four trenches each 30m by 1.8m in plan randomly arrayed to examine the proposed development area.   Archaeological features consisting of a small fire pit or hearth and a possible tree throw containing burnt flint were recorded in Trenches 1 and 2 to the north of the site. The features lacked conclusive dating evidence but are considered likely to be of prehistoric date. A feature of post-medieval date recorded in Trench 1 is of unclear purpose, but might be associated with agricultural activity.   Trenches 2, 3 and 4 also contained substantial geological features referred to in this report as sinkholes. A small quantity of residual cultural material was recovered from the upper levels of these features.  Unstratified finds from the site included a small number of worked flints including one example of probable Mesolithic or possibly earlier date as well as a single abraded sherd of Roman pottery and a post-medieval cloth seal.

Part of the site had previously investigated within the East Anglia One cable route and had been subject to geophysical survey prior to this trial-trenching.   Archaeological features were recorded in 23 of the 29 excavated trenches, representing a low density/complexity scatter of remains across the site. A very small quantity of residual struck flint artefacts suggests some activity of Mesolithic to Early Neolithic date in the vicinity of the site. A single pit of later prehistoric date, a pit of late Iron Age or Roman date and a Roman ditch were also identified. However, much of the archaeological activity recorded was undated, and comprised pits, ditches, gullies and a single posthole. A short section of wall of AD1500 date was identified within the west of the site and a ditch containing CBM of the same date was located towards the east edge of the site.

The  purpose of the Watching Brief was to provide base-line data regarding the character,  extent and archaeological potential of the alluvial and peat stratigraphy that may be  effected by the Scheme.  The sedimentary sequences recorded in the interventions broadly comprised a  relatively shallow Holocene peat of probable Bronze Age and later date, overlying a  complex of late Devensian deposits related to cold climate solifluction, fluvial and  aeolian processes. In places these deposits overlay fluvial gravels of Pleistocene  age above the bedrock geology of Ampthill Clay. A discrete organic horizon lying at  depth within the Pleistocene sequence may relate to temperate stage deposits  known to exist in the area, either the Ipswichian Interglacial or Devensian Late  Glacial Interstadial.  Although no archaeological features or artefacts were observed during the Watching  Brief, a number of archaeological sites are known to be present within the Study  Area and in the immediate vicinity. Within the Study Area this comprises artifact  scatters of Mesolithic and Neolithic date, probably associated with a relict dryland  ground surface at the interface between the peat and late Devensian deposits.

Pottery from the pit, the posthole and the ditches was of late Iron  Age/early Roman date, probably spanning the crossover time of these two  periods. The presence of a number of flints of Mesolithic and Neolithic  date to the south-west part of the site suggest a prehistoric focus lies  nearby.

A substantial Roman settlement including occupation remains and burials underlies the Airbase.  The settlement spanned the whole of the Roman period. Coin scatters, pottery and a probable field boundary fence line indicate the furthest the settlement extends towards the assessment site.    In the Saxon period there was continuity of settlement up until the 8th century seen in a large and regionally-important cemetery including warrior burials and high status interments accompanied by horses. No accompanying settlement has been located although there is some Early and Middle Saxon occupation on the eastern side of the cemetery. It may be that the cemetery served several communities in the area and that no sizeable settlement existed around RAF Lakenheath.     In the medieval period the only known SMR find spot actually located within the assessment site is the post-medieval hunting lodge called 'Lower Lodge' that was probably the stone built warrener's house documented on early maps but now no longer extant.

It was represented by cut features (mostly rubbish pits and ditches, with occasional post holes and gardening feature), all of which were likely associated with the Hollingbourne Union Workhouse known to have occupied the adjacent White Heath property between 1836 and 1920's.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Oxford Archaeology East carried out an archaeological evaluation consisting of 23 trial trenches at land off Kiln Road, Thundersley in two phases over April and June 2013. The site lies within an area where Mesolithic and Neolithic worked flints have been recorded, although not from the site itself. In the Medieval period the site formed part of a deer park.   No worked flints were found and there was no definite evidence of the Medieval deer park or any related activities. The only feature which may possibly be deer park-related is a depression which had been filled with gravel.   A scatter of late 17th century or 18th century peg-tile was found at the northern end of the site which indicates a Post-Medieval building nearby.  Deliberate tree planting was in evidence in three of the trenches. These appear to line up with field boundaries showing on the OS 2nd edition map of 1898. Several ditches and other pits were recorded in the evaluation, either undated or Post-Medieval or modern in date. Modern rubbish pits were revealed at the rear of houses on Wensley Road and Kiln Road.</value>

The site originally formed part of a larger field named 'Tarn Field'. By the late 19th century a range of buildings had been constructed at the southern end of this field, most probably to form a timber yard for James Coward and Sons Timber Merchants, who remained in operation until the early 20th century. More recently the site was used as a garage.  The evaluation comprised two trenches each c8m long. Trench 1 was very shallow. It was cut by a modern pipe trench at the north end and had been disturbed at this end by the demolition of the buildings on site. Trench 2 contained a sequence of dumped deposits above the natural, which contained finds mostly of late 18th to early 19th century date, although amongst them was a residual handle fragment from a medieval vessel and a possible flint core of late Mesolithic to early Neolithic date. No significant archaeological deposits or features were observed.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">During December 2003 Archaeological Solutions carried out an archaeological evaluation at 57-59 Great Suffolk Street, Southwark, London, SE1 (centred on NGR TQ 3188 7985).  The topography of Southwark has changed considerably as the level of the Thames rose and fell.  Used for farming during the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods the area flooded in the later Bronze Age.  Roman Southwark was based on a sandy island surrounded by water channels, marshes and mudflats.  Previous excavations suggest that this area was part of a tidal mudflat, situated west of the main settlement.    The area was drained, raised and became drier in the medieval period.  Settlement was concentrated around London Bridge, but later extended to areas such as Bankside.  Again, the site was on the outskirts of the town but by the late 18th century, the area around the site was being developed.  Although maps record small buildings on the site, the recently demolished buildings (formerly used as a bacon factory), were only built in the late 19th or early 20th century.    The evaluation revealed a shallow natural channel or depression, cutting the alluvial clays at a depth of 1.20m AOD.  The natural gravels were recorded at a depth of 1.00m AOD.  A post-medieval brick-lined well was recorded in Trench 1 cutting this channel, and a brick wall was located in Trench 2.  Approximately 1.60m of recent overburden covered these deposits.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation on the site of the proposed new library building revealed further evidence for the occupation on the site dating back to the prehistoric times.Mesolithic activity on or near the site was suggested by a small quantity of worked flint debitage recovered from later deposits. There was clearer evidence for Late Iron Age/early Roman activity which previously had only been suggested by the recovery of Iron Age finds from later deposits. Two ditches may relate to water management of the site but a series of postholes may also indicate the presence of structures. By far, the majority of the evidence dates to the Roman period. A series of intercutting ditches provides a well-dated sequence for occupation on the site through the 1st to the 4th centuries. The ditches and gullies appear to be associated with water management, though the latest Roman ditch in the sequence had a distinctive V-shaped profile characteristic of a boundary or enclosure ditch which may signify a change in character of the occupation during this time. The features were sealed by medieval layers, dating from the mid-11th century. This appears to be the earliest dated evidence for the reoccupation of the site following the short-lived 5th-century Saxon building recorded during the previous evaluation work. Renewed activity in the 17th-century associated with landscaping of the Palace garden was evidenced by a bedding trench and a wide path located near the perimeter wall. </value>

The fieldwork was commissioned by Waterman Group in advance of the redevelopment of the site.    The earliest activity on the site is represented by residual Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flint working.    The most significant aspect of the archaeology is evidence of Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (c.800-600BC) activity on the site, consisting of various enclosures/field boundaries, pitting and possible structures. The density of activity from this period within a relatively small area suggests the site is part of a much wider Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age landscape.     Some later Iron Age/Early Roman activity (40BC-AD70) is also present on site. This phase of occupation is smaller scale than that of the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age, with much of the later activity focused on pits, thought to be small scale gravel quarrying, however there appears to be some continuation in how the site is being utilised, with enclosure ditches conforming to earlier alignments, and a possible later intentional deposition of artefacts within an earlier ditch terminus.    The final phase of activity on the site is the building of Bedford Lodge and the laying out of the orchards and formal gardens in 1815. This building is extended in 1823 and again in 1836.    The whole site was demolished in 1955 and a tarmacked playground for Holland Park School built upon it.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report provides the results of the third season of archaeological investigation of a 3.7ha field called Little Stiances, located at Sharpsbridge Lane, Newick, East Sussex. This work was carried out in May 2016.    Geophysical and topographic surveys carried out in 2010 confirmed the location of a 'lost' cottage known from cartographic sources and allowed the targeting of test-pits at that location both in 2010 and during the second season of investigation in 2013.    This season the 'Cottage Site' again produced a variety of finds reflecting the occupation of buildings in that part of the field, mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Finds ranged from the expected pottery, glass and clay pipes of a post-medieval assemblage, to the bricks and tiles from the demolished buildings, to more 'personal' artefacts such as a Victorian coin, a key, buttons, fragments of shoes/boots and hand tools, as well as a possible element of the cottage's furniture.    Further test-pits were located on earthworks and anomalies from geophysical surveys and cartographic sources. The discovery of the brick floor at one such location strongly suggests the presence of the buried remains from a post-medieval barn shown in a map of 1739 and hinted at in the results of the geophysical survey. The remains have been left in situ.    A scatter of medieval pottery discovered across the site suggests some of the earthworks may date from this era. The recovery of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork highlights the use of the general area by Hunter/Gatherers.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Excavation was carried out around the recycling centre on RAF Lakenheath, including a community excavation. The archaeological horizons of the site remained largely well preserved.     This area of the airbase lies directly north of a substantial boundary to the Roman settlement, in what appears to be a less intensively occupied zone. The earliest remains consisted of Mesolithic and Neolithic flints. A series of natural hollows had formed prior to the main occupation and the largest of these was intensively sieved, with a soil monolith sample taken to characterise its formation.     A stage of later Iron Age to early Roman pits preceded or ran concurrent with the earliest phase of Roman ditches in the 1st century. The ditches proceeded to spread more intensively over much of the site throughout the 1st and 2nd centuries, entirely dominating the area. The ditches are interpreted field and paddock enclosures, as well as possible droveways, whilst also functioning to drain the area that was clearly quite wet throughout the Roman occupation. Limited evidence for fence/palisade ditches was also recorded. A series of layers formed across the site towards the end of the Roman occupation, associated with rising water levels. These appear to have caused a temporary break in occupation, after which a single phase of ditches on different alignments formed a rudimentary enclosure.     The last phase of archaeological cut features was a series of 5th-7th century Anglo-Saxon pits. The pits produced cereal processing waste, as well as evidence for domestic and craft related activity.</value>

With the exception of the burnt flint, the distribution of finds presents no obvious patterning, and the volume of prehistoric material is considered surprisingly low given the proximity of a large complex of Neolithic earthworks located c.300m to the north and c.700m to the northwest of the site.</value>

No cut features or archaeological remains from the earlier periods were identified on the site. Further, no flint artefacts were found on the site (in situ or redeposited) despite being located within the area that had been exploited during the prehistoric times, particularly the Mesolithic period. The results of the evaluation confirmed the undeveloped character of the site prior to the late 19th century, when the construction of St Cuthbert's building had taken place.

<value columnNumber="1">The shovel pit evaluation comprised 200 pits excavated on a grid at 10m intervals. The results suggest that there is a low potential for the presence of Mesolithic to Neolithic flint and chert working within the site; only two worked artefacts of flint and chert were recovered with the large majority of chert found being unworked. This indicates that the artefact scatters identified across Waterswallows Lane do not extend into the current site. No artefactual material of later prehistoric, Roman or medieval date was recovered, again suggesting the potential for buried archaeology associated with these periods is low. The majority of artefacts recovered were of post-medieval to modern date, and were of low archaeological significance.

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological watching brief was conducted during the construction of improved sea defences at the Blundellsands Sailing Club, Hightown, Sefton, Merseyside. The aim of the watching brief was to provide information on the presence/absence, location and characteristics of archaeological remains at the site. Although there is little direct evidence for settlement in the study area during the  Prehistoric or Romano-British periods, there is a range of palaeo-environmental evidence and stray finds from the foreshore which suggests that there is considerable potential for deposits dating to these periods. This potential is further highlighted by the exposure of a suite of human and animal footprints at Formby Point to the north and by a prehistoric trackway excavated to the south of the study area. During the preparation of the report further trails of human footprints, provisionally dated to the Mesolithic, were found on the foreshore c. 2 km to the south. Within the study area deposits of peat relating to a 'submerged forest' exposed on the foreshore are of particular significance for the Prehistoric period. The peat deposits at Hightown appear to have accumulated into two discrete basins separated by a narrow ridge of silty sand running broadly north-west to south-east. The deposits of peat to the north of this ridge are different in character to those to the  south. Those to the northern are finer an more fibrous in consistency than those to the south which contained more substantial wood fragments including in situ tree stumps.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Over a period of two days in December 2011, a programme of community fieldwalking was  undertaken in two fields, known as Upper Church Field and the Lays and Churchyard Field  to the west of the Hamlet of Brundon and situated just west of the town of Sudbury. The  fieldwalking programme was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund as part of the Managing a  Masterpiece programme in the Stour Valley and enabled nearly 70 local residents and  school children from the surrounding area to take part. The project was supervised by  Access Cambridge Archaeology at the University of Cambridge.    The two fields were sited on the higher ground overlooking both the River Stour to the east  and the Belchamp Brook to the north and suggest that the site saw quite a bit of prehistoric  activity with evidence for flint tool production from the Mesolithic period onwards. No  Roman pottery was identified and only a single sherd of Late Anglo Saxon pot was  recorded that does point to some of the early village origins may have been on this area of  high ground, which also saw limited use through the medieval period. The site remained as  fields through the post medieval and later with probably intermittent use.</value>

The work was carried out between 31st January and 2nd February 2011 by Archaeology South-East under commission from 4Delivery Limited (4D) on behalf of their client Southern Water prior to the development of the land immediately north of the Overton Water Treatment Works to increase the capacity of the existing plant.     A total of six trenches measuring between 20 and 30 metres in length were excavated to assess the archaeological potential of the site in advance of a formal planning application.    The site lies on the Upper Chalk, indicated on British Geological Survey Sheet 283, and lies to the north of The Lynch to the north-west of Overton village.    The evaluation trenches encountered the natural geology at a maximum height of 105.78 mAOD in the northwest of the site (Trench 3) and a minimum of 101.75 mAOD in the mid-eastern side of the site (Trench 5).    Two sections of linear ditches and a gully were identified as well as two pits. The ditch sections may represent one or two ditches of probable Mesolithic or early Neolithic date, while one of the pits contained Beaker pottery and Neolithic flints. The Beaker pottery suggests a site of potential regional significance, as it is very rare in the county of Hampshire.  </value>

This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier.

<value columnNumber="1">Wessex Archaeology was commissioned to complete an archaeological excavation on land  between Sutton Bridge and Windsor Farm, to the south-east of Queen Camel, Somerset. The investigation formed part of a programme of archaeological works required by the Planning Authority in advance of a solar PV development. In late 2014, the initial archaeological contractor (Context One Archaeological Services) opened five excavation areas targeted on previously identified geophysical anomalies before having to withdraw from the project. Wessex Archaeology subsequently assumed responsibility, undertaking the remainder of the fieldwork. Residual probable Mesolithic and other pre-Bronze Age worked flint suggest a background of prehistoric activity in the wider area. Pottery found within another sequence of ring-gullies, a post-pit, and a number of ditches indicate a small Middle Bronze Age farmstead and associated rectilinear field system (Areas 2, 4 and 5). Two overlapping ring-gullies and a cluster of postholes in Area 3 are almost certainly prehistoric. Remnants of extensive medieval/post-medieval ridge and furrow were also in evidence across the Site. These findings broadly correspond with the patterns of archaeological activity discussed in the South Cadbury Environs Project (Tabor 2002; 2004), and with those encountered during Wessex Archaeology's West Camel Road excavations, c. 1km to the west (WA 2015). As such they may, in consultation with the Planning Authority, warrant further consideration and publication.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In accordance with the Written Scheme of Investigation (MOLA 2016), geoarchaeological augerholes were undertaken across the site (Phases 1-5) to retrieve the full sequence of sediments existing on the site to a depth unobtainable through trenching. The sampling took the form of terrier rig auger samples (G5 to G18).    The results of the work outlined in this interim report showed that the site lies within the wider floodplain of the Thames with gravels topped by peat lying under historic alluvial deposits which in turn are buried beneath deep sequences of made ground partly consisting of disturbed alluvial deposits. The model of the early Holocene or Mesolithic topography indicates the site occupies relatively high ground in close proximity to ancient channel courses within undulating gravel deposits typical of the floodplain environment.    The work carried out on the augerholes from RAD15 indicates their potential to provide a record of landscape change from the Late Pleistocene through to the historic period which can integrate the site with models and other site data from the Lower Thames area. Although no direct evidence was found on the site of human occupation, indirect evidence of human activity around the site is likely to be retained in microfossil data within the deposits.   </value>

Residual finds of Mesolithic and Neolithic flintwork, and Roman pottery, also suggest a presence during these periods. A series of geological deposits provided information regarding prehistoric land use of the site. The Middle Bronze Age features were buried beneath a series of waterlain deposits. The main features of the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age activity were a series of re-cut ditches belonging to a field-system or enclosure in the northern half of the site with waterlain deposits of this date to the south.

Part of the site had previously investigated within the East Anglia One cable route and had been subject to geophysical survey prior to this trial-trenching.   Archaeological features were recorded in 23 of the 29 excavated trenches, representing a low density/complexity scatter of remains across the site. A very small quantity of residual struck flint artefacts suggests some activity of Mesolithic to Early Neolithic date in the vicinity of the site. A single pit of later prehistoric date, a pit of late Iron Age or Roman date and a Roman ditch were also identified. However, much of the archaeological activity recorded was undated, and comprised pits, ditches, gullies and a single posthole. A short section of wall of AD1500 date was identified within the west of the site and a ditch containing CBM of the same date was located towards the east edge of the site.   Peat deposits within a possible palaeochannel, identified running roughly east to west across the south of the site demonstrated a good survival of waterlogged material and have a high potential to yield palaeoenvironmental remains.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation was undertaken by Cotswold  Archaeology in November and December 2015 at the request of  Ashford Homes (South West) Limited at Land East of Fulwell Lane,  Faulkland, Hemington, Somerset.  The earliest evidence for activity comprised small quantities of  residual flints suggestive of transient hunter-gatherer activity during  the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic period. A few sherds of later Iron  Age pottery were also residual. The earliest cut features comprised  two enclosures forming part of a Roman rural settlement. These  were found in association with pottery, animal bone, charred plant  remains and a small quantity of metalwork, slag and fired clay.  Although no structural remains were found and only a very small  quantity of ceramic building material, this range of finds is  suggestive of occupation. The pottery assemblage indicates that  this took place during the Early Roman period, up to c. AD  175/200. There were also three burials - two inhumations and one  cremation. Following the deliberate infilling of the enclosure  ditches, fields or enclosures were laid out with much shallower,  intermittently surviving ditches, and the centre of habitation shifted  beyond the site. There was little dating evidence for this phase, but  it is suggested that these fields or enclosures were later Roman  and they perhaps formed part of a nearby Roman villa estate. The  site was truncated by later quarry pits which probably dated to the  medieval and/or post-medieval periods.</value>

These were identified  chiefly in the form of Iron-age/ Romano-British field system ditches. Amongst the ditches were scattered post holes and other small discreet features. The ditches could well form cattle enclosures as found at Warren Lane excavations to the North (Thomas., 2011). Further to the north-east in phase 8 as the grounds drops, there is less in the way of archaeological remains but a an area quite intense with Palaeochannels. A single ditch continued from phase 6 (south field), but then it was just the occasional pit identified. Of particular interest was a pit which contained Neolithic pottery along with a large amount of worked flint dating back to the Mesolithic period. Also a linear pit containing burnt stone was located close to the meander of the old river channel (Palaeochannel) suggesting early activity in the area. This may have been burnt stone deposited into the pit from elsewhere along the river, perhaps from a burnt mound. These date from the Neolithic and various suggestions include heating the stone to a high temperature in a linear pit lined by a timber trough to heat water for cooking. Also an early form of sauna has been suggested. Tree clearance burns have also been identified further south which are indicative of Pre-historic tree clearance as also indicate the possibility of burnt mounds in the locality. Overall the indications are a site dating from the Neolithic through Romano-British period.</value>

The archaeological work was commissioned by Ipswich Borough Council in prior to proposed development and ground remediation works on the site.  The aim of the work was to characterise the archaeological potential of the proposed development area.    The earliest activity was evidenced by a ring gully, key-hole oven and a rubbish deposit within a natural hollow. Small sherds of pottery tentatively dated to the prehistoric period were recovered from the oven, along with struck flints dating to the Mesolithic/Neolithic period - flints dating to this period were also recovered from the ring gully. Due to the form of the ring gully and oven it is believed that these features date to the Iron Age period, despite the lack of supporting cultural material. Industrial material and a significant number of seeds were recovered from the oven and the natural hollow, suggesting that these features were contemporary.  The majority of the site has been heavily truncated and landscaped by modern activity, predominantly relating to the former sugar beet factory that occupied the site in the latter 20th century.  </value>

Fourteen trenches were excavated.    Previous archaeological investigations to the immediate north of the site had recorded a complex of mainly Iron Age features, including a series of enclosure and boundary ditches.  Geophysical surveys of the present evaluation site indicated the presence of similar features throughout the site.    The evaluation recorded a series of ditches and a small number of pits, as well as the remnants of a stone wall.  These features displayed a broad correspondence with the results of the geophysical surveys.  Artefactural material indicated that the features were mainly Iron Age and Roman in date, although there was also limited evidence for Mesolithic and Bronze Age activity at the site.  The features exposed by the present evaluation were broadly similar in nature and date to the features recorded previously to the immediate north of the site, although there was a greater amount of Roman material from the present site.  The site appears to have been in continuous occupation in the Iron Age and Roman periods, although the limited evidence for activity after the 3rd century AD suggests that the site was abandoned in the later Roman period.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Three evaluation trenches were excavated and two borehole samples collected on the site. Alluvial deposits, almost certainly associated with the Tyburn/Tachbrook/Kingschoole Sluice system were investigated and sampled. The existing building on the site had removed any layers or features associated with human activity that may once have existed on the site. There was therefore no evidence for the post-medieval development of the area.      The results of the post excavation assessment showed that the site shares stratigraphic and environmental similarities with other sites across the Westminster and Pimlico area. A total of three facies were identified from Pleistocene (arctic climate) gravels through to Late Neolithc and later alluvial silt and, finally, modern made ground.    Modelling of the early Holocene or Mesolithic topography indicates the site initially occupied an almost central position near where the Tyburn entered the floodplain at the end of the Pleistocene. The pollen suggested a riparian environment adjacent to the Tyburn which silted up over time from the late Neolithic onward.    Although no direct evidence was found on the site of human occupation, indirect evidence of human activity was recorded in the form of cereal pollen following the opening up of the environment particularly throughout the historic  period.  </value>

Natural gravels were recorded at the W end of the site, and these were capped in some of the boreholes by a sandy clay deposit which was probably deposited in a stream channel during the Mesolithic or Neolithic periods. Overlying the sands and gravels in many of the pits and boreholes were peats and organic clays. Wood taken from the peaty layer was identified as Ash (Fraxinus). It is likely that the tree grew within the Alder Carr environment represented by the organic deposit and had fallen naturally, but the possibility that it related to prehistoric activity cannot be ruled out. The organic clay/peat may represent a single deposit formed as a by-product of the marine transgression that occurred after the last glaciation, or it could have accumulated in former channel threads, which became abandoned at different times due to shifting channels during the Holocene. The peat was overlain by a layer of clay and silty clay, probably forming salt marsh/intertidal mudflats as estuarine conditions encroached further up the course of the Thames from the Iron Age onwards. Parts of this deposit might also represent seasonal overbank flooding throughout the later Holocene probably up to the early 18th-century.

The latter comprises the construction of a new driving range and a practice area, in addition to the construction of a reservoir.    The site is located in a rural area, c. 4km north of the London North Circular road, and c.4km south of the M25.  It is situated in the Lea valley, an area known for Palaeolithic and Mesolithic deposits and find spots. The site is also situated between two small hamlets with a significant number of Grade II listed buildings in their historic cores, in addition to a Second World War anti-air gun site, now a designated scheduled monument. Despite this, no archaeological finds are known to have originated from within the 54.7ha of the golf course grounds.

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of an assessment on three geoarchaeological boreholes carried out by Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) on the site of London Dock, Tower Hamlets, London E1. The boreholes were drilled with a terrier rig to the surface of the Pleistocene sand and gravel in order to recover Holocene floodplain deposits seen in the watching brief. Unfortunately the sample recovery was limited to one borehole (BHR2) because of the intransigence and extent of the modern made ground and historic backfilling deposits at other locations. However, the assessment carried out on the borehole sample provided a record of landscape change particularly through the late Neolithic and Bronze Age periods when a marsh developed over the gravel floodplain which had remained high and dry throughout the Mesolithic. Although no direct evidence was found on the site of human occupation, there was much indirect evidence particularly through pollen assessment of agricultural activity locally during this period probably on the higher terrace to the north of the site. </value>

The test-pits and borehole sample logs revealed varying depths of made-ground, some of which may be of archaeological interest. A window sample to the east of New Walk encountered a timber stake 1.5m below ground level which may be part of a buried quayside structure.  A borehole in the Steamer Quay car park identified peat layers between 6.5 and 11.8m below ground level, which may date from before or during the Mesolithic marine transgression into the Dart Estuary.</value>

One hundred and ninety three  trenches, some of which were located on anomalies identified  during an earlier geophysical survey, were excavated.  A small number of archaeological features were identified during  the evaluation. The majority of these features were identified within  the northern half of the site.  A concentration of features, comprising pits, ditches and postholes,  was identified in the north-eastern corner of the site. One of the  ditches contained worked flint flakes of Mesolithic or Early Neolithic  date and it is possible that the remaining, undated, features in this  area are broadly contemporary. A small number of further ditches  identified across the site, were found to contain worked flint of  prehistoric date, although the possibility remains that this material  is residual. A ditch identified in the north central part of the site  confirmed the presence of a curving linear feature identified by the  preceding geophysical survey. Late prehistoric pottery was  recovered from this feature; however the possibility remains that  this pottery is residual. A burnt mound, of probable prehistoric date,  was identified close to the course of a brook in the north-western  corner of the site. Two pits, two ditches and a compact stony  deposit, the latter possibly representing a trackway, working  platform or surface, were identified in the same trench and may be  associated with the burnt mound.</value>

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green.

The work was undertaken prior to peat restoration works which is understood to include work to areas of both bare and hagged peat, and the blocking of 20th century grips using machine cut peat plugs. Three areas formed part of the survey; the Northern Survey Area; Southern Survey Area 1; and Southern Survey Area 2. The archaeological survey and assessment of landscape palaeoenvironmental potential was designed to augment a pre-intervention record of archaeological remains in the area and to inform the moorland restoration process, highlighting where any unnecessary damage to archaeological features either through the cutting of peat plugs, re-profiling of hags, or through access with tracked excavators, could be avoided.     Known archaeological remains in the area from a search of the Historic Environment Record (HER) and National Trust records are confined mostly to Mesolithic findspots of flint and 19th and 20th century activity, including quarrying and boundary marking.    The walkover survey has identified further 49 archaeological remains within the survey area.

The evaluation phase identified a naturally occurring curving ridge which crossed the site in an east-west direction. Substantial layers of hillwash had built up on the southern and northern sides of this ridge before the later formalization of the field boundaries in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries surrounding the site. Numerous ceramic artefacts dating predominantly to the nineteenth century, as well as agricultural drains were identified within the site most likely relating to activity emanating from the nearby Home Farm. A quantity of worked lithics of early prehistoric (late Mesolithic to early Bronze Age) date was also recovered. Two small postholes were also found at depth cut into the natural subsoil which formed a flat terrace to the north of the curving ridge.     Test-pitting identified two possible concentrations of prehistoric lithics which may indicate the presence of a possible prehistoric domestic or industrial site either within or close to the assessment area. As well as the prehistoric artefacts a large number of other finds, ceramic, glass, metal etc., were recovered, mainly of a 19th century or later date though three sherds of post medieval reduced ware pottery were also recovered from the site suggesting possible 16th to 17th century activity as well.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeological excavation of an area 7.66ha was conducted on land at Charing Heath, Kent, in response to a proposed extension of Charing Quarry.     Prehistoric activity comprised late Mesolithic worked flint with potential associated occupation, and early-mid Neolithic, late Bronze Age-early Iron Age, and mid-late Iron Age features, including ditches, pits, a potential sunken-featured-building and Bronze Age hoard.    Late Iron Age-early Roman activity comprised ditches, trackway and pits. These were superseded by ditches, trackway, post-holes, pits and a limekiln. Placed-deposits within some pits, evidence for iron smelting, and a plough-damaged coin hoard (AD 64-85) were also recovered.     Roman activity dated no later than the mid second century, and this hiatus continued until the thirteenth-century, represented by ditches forming the west-side of an enclosure surrounding a contemporary farm and adjacent chantry chapel, the remains of which are protected. Post-medieval to modern features reflect continuity from this medieval land use, and included field boundary ditches illustrated on a manorial map dated 1639, pits, post-holes, a masonry footing or drain, and a metalled yard associated with the chantry farm.

<value columnNumber="1">Three conventional sediment samples and six burnt flints obtained from section A11 of the Bletchingley excavations were submitted for optical and thermoluminescence dating, respectively, by English Heritage. An attempt to quantify the accuracy of all luminescence age estimates was made using signal analysis methods to detect partial resetting of datable signals prior to sample interment, and through consideration of the influence of varying moisture content and cosmic dose rate over the burial period. Optical dating evolved a chronology of sedimentation, not necessarily continuous, from c 32ka (30,000 BC) through to c 2.8 ka (800 BC). Three flints were excluded from the study owing to evidence of insufficient heating prior to burial. The remaining flints, located in close proximity to each optical dating sample, generated age estimates of c 7 to 12 ka (5000 to 10,000 BC) consistent with age expectations premised upon microliths recovered from equivalent levels across the site. However, a significant inversion in age between the lowermost optical dating sample and the underlying flint sample was recorded. After considering the accuracy of De and dose rate estimates for both sample types, this anomaly was attributed to displacement of the flint samples from its primary context by anthropogenic activity or gravitational effects coupled with low adhesion afforded by the sand matrix within which all the flint samples were located. Similar displacement, for all the flint samples that have yielded age estimate in this study, cannot be dismissed. The juxtaposition of Mesolithic burnt flints and Iron Age sediments and charcoal in the uppermost dated unit evidences a period of land surface stability and repeated human occupation of this area.  </value>

The excavation followed an archaeological desk-based assessment and trial trench evaluation, also conducted by AS.  Associated historical documentary research was also undertaken.    The site occupies an area of archaeological significance as recorded by the Suffolk Historic Environment Record.  Dispersed prehistoric, Roman and medieval remains have been encountered within and around the site. Archaeological evaluation of the site (Phases 1 and 2) encountered a number of features including three medieval ditches and an undated kiln- or oven-type feature.  Additional undated features were thought to form part of the immediate medieval landscape.  The post-medieval site appears to have constituted agricultural land, part of the Eldo Estate, and boundaries of this date survive.    The Phase 1 excavation encountered a system of rectilinear, ditched medieval (12th-14th century AD) enclosures, containing the remains of eight grain drying kilns (or probable remains thereof).  A contemporary stone-lined well and posthole structure were also present.  The earliest material recovered constitutes a modest assemblage of struck flint, indicative of Mesolithic and early Neolithic technology.  A single residual sherd of Roman pottery was also found, in addition to a limited number of post-medieval finds.  No features of these dates were encountered.

Project highlights include the discovery of features relating to a possible later prehistoric/Roman defended site (1612203) in Block 1 and, in Block 3, the remains of a formal garden in the grounds of Walton Hall (1619511). The main products of the project were digital transcriptions of the form and extent of archaeological features seen on aerial images with supporting descriptions in the National Record of the Historic Environment (NRHE).  The project was carried out between March 2017 and July 2018.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">PCAS Archaeology Ltd (PCAS) was commissioned by Mr and Mrs Foxon, to undertake a scheme of archaeological mitigation on a plot of land known as Fair Field, to the north of Skegness Road, Partney, in the East Lindsey District of Lincolnshire (NGR: TF 41165 68345).  This work was undertaken to fulfil the terms of conditions attached to a planning application for the residential development of the site, based upon the results of an archaeological trail trench evaluation carried out in 2013.  Evidence for prehistoric activity was demonstrated with the collection of numerous worked flint artefacts, spanning the Mesolithic to Bronze Age. The earliest evidence for sustained activity consisted of pits and ditches dated to the Mid-Late Saxon period. Evidence of rare copper working during the Late Saxon/Saxo-Norman period, was recovered from one of the pits.  The identification of numerous and assorted building remains demonstrated that the site had been occupied post-Conquest and probably sub-divided into linear tenement plots with buildings being constructed along the street front and extending piecemeal into the back-plots. This provides previously unrecorded evidence of the Norman re-ordering of the site and subsequent development of the town.  Evidence for the abandonment of some early buildings and re-modelling of others records a general pattern of decline with perhaps the plots becoming vacant by the 17th century although with some opportunistic use after this time. This evidences the historically recorded decline of the town and may redefine Partney as a shrunken medieval town. The earliest evidence for maintaining livestock on the site was as late as the 18th century.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Over a period of two days in March 2011 a programme of community field-walking was undertaken on a field known as Tile Field, southeast of Bures St Mary in Suffolk. The field-walking was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund as part of the Managing a Masterpiece programme in the Stour Valley and supervised by Access Cambridge Archaeology at the University of Cambridge.  With just one field walked, results are difficult to interpret, but they suggest that site was lightly used throughout most of the prehistoric period from the Mesolithic onwards, with a short episode of localised more intensive use in the late Bronze age or early Iron Age. From the Roman period the site appears to have been in use as arable, perhaps manured from a settlement nearby. Small amounts of pottery hint at some human presence in the Anglo-Saxon period, and possibly of a small farmstead or cottage just to the north of the site in the high medieval period up to about 1400 AD. Thereafter the site seems to been used as fields, with very little post-medieval or modern material recovered, apart from very large amounts of roof tile primarily found in one corner of the site, possibly brought there from elsewhere.</value>

The work was undertaken in order to provide further information concerning the archaeological potential of the site, in advance of a planning application for the construction of a new residential development.  The trenching revealed a complex of archaeological features containing a mix of different periods in pottery and stratigraphic relationships with the subsoil and natural horizon. The features represent a mix of boundary and enclosure ditches with a concentration of pits to the east that matched with the results from the geophysical survey. Trenches 5, 6 and 7 represented the most archaeological dense areas of the site with several large linear ditches and pits revealed during the evaluation and containing material culture from the Roman and Medieval  period and serval pieces of worked flint, residual deposits dated from the Mesolithic and early Neolithic period. Trenches 4 and 9 did not reveal any deposits or artefacts of archaeological interest suggesting the limit of archaeological potential lays to the north and northeast of the proposed site.  The trenching revealed a site of high archaeological potential with the archaeological remains indicated a multiple phase occupation extending from the roman period to the medieval.

Twenty-three archaeological sites were recorded and excavated, following targeted evaluation trenching and during a permanent-presence watching brief on the topsoil stripping and pipe-trenching. In addition, twenty-seven areas were topographically surveyed, of which seventeen were relict field systems and nine were earthwork sites. All the associated field boundaries were recorded on the route, which included seventy-two remnant medieval field boundaries and three hundred and thirty-five dry stone walls. The earliest site was a Mesolithic flint scatter found in topsoil at Wham, near Settle. An oval stone ring was excavated at Bank Newton, near to Gargrave. This monument is currently thought to have been a type of ring cairn constructed during the early Bronze Age or possibly the Neolithic period. A semi-circular gully and associated features, excavated at Thorlby Springs, has provisionally been interpreted as the remains of a late Neolithic or the early Bronze Age timber structure. A waterlogged burnt mound with an intact wooden trough, excavated at Turnbers Hill, and a burnt mound site at Backland Wood are so far undated but may be middle Bronze Age or earlier. A previously unrecorded example of prehistoric rock art, a cup-marked boulder, was located on the pipeline route in a field between the villages of Embsay and Halton East. Three stone-built medieval to post-medieval domestic buildings were excavated at Scales, Halton and Lawkland Green.

The site was approximately 0.5 ha in size and the evaluation comprised six trenches totalling 180m. Geophysics had previously been carried out at the site and had identified a Bronze Age barrow, approximately 25m in diameter, which is one of three located within the field. Trench 1 was positioned across the diameter of the barrow; in both excavated sections the ring-ditch was shallow, measuring a maximum of 0.2m deep. As a result, Trench 6 was opened, to determine whether the ditch was a similar depth to the east. Surprisingly, the ring-ditch was deeper in Trench 6, measuring 0.5m deep. No burial or human remains were identified, either within, or associated with, the barrow. A small undated pit or hollow was excavated inside the area of the barrow, close to its southern edge. Nearby, a similar feature was only partially exposed and remained unexcavated. The only other features encountered during the evaluation were two tree throws in Trenches 2 and 4.  Finds were rare, totalling two small fragments of animal bone (one cattle tooth and one pig tooth, 32g), a small heavily patinated flint blade of Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic date, which had broken in antiquity (1g) and a single tiny sherd of pot (1g), all from the barrow ring-ditch in Trench 6. Three bulk samples were taken to assess the quality of preservation of plant remains and their potential to provide useful data. Plant remains are sparse and are preserved by carbonization (charring) caused by exposure to fire. The better preserved grains can be tentatively identified as a prehistoric hulled wheat, either emmer or spelt. </value>

Residual Early medieval pottery was also identified with further Early medieval pottery within a property boundary ditch suggesting that the land was initially divided into two plots at this time, perhaps for agriculture.    In the High medieval period two buildings were constructed on the plots fronting onto Rye Road, with the land to the rear of the northern property being further divided into smaller units. There is a large refuse pits associated with the northern property, and to a much lesser degree in the southern plot also. Some of these contained waster pottery suggesting a close association with the known pottery production site to the north of the site.    The site went into sudden decline in the Later medieval period representing the abandonment of the site and robbing of the buildings to reuse building materials.     Early Post medieval activities are also largely absent with an apparent hiatus of activity between 1550 and 1750 indicating continued abandonment of the site during which time a small amount of colluvium was deposited at the rear of the properties.    During the Late Post medieval period there is little in the way of datable finds although a few potsherds may suggest manuring of the land for arable cultivation.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Over the summer of 2014, a team of archaeologists from University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) excavated a 3.3 hectare site at Stablebridge Road, Aston Clinton, near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Work was commissioned by Taylor Wimpey (South Midlands) and was carried out in advance of new housing development. Excavation found evidence of late Iron Age and Roman settlement within the 'Icknield Belt', a broad zone following the chalk escarpment of the Chiltern Hills known to have been favoured for settlement in prehistoric and later periods. The site also lies close to Akeman Street, the Roman road between St Albans and Cirencester, which runs through the village. Small areas of Mesolithic and early Anglo-Saxon activity has also been identified. A notable find of the project was the first excavated evidence for a a trackway running parallel with the foot of the Chiltern escarpment. As information presently stands, it is our best evidence for a pre-medieval trackway that can be given the name 'Lower Icknield Way'. Evidence is clear, however, that it does not pre-date the Roman period, and therefore, cannot be part of a prehistoric pan-British routeway, as has previously been suggested. Instead, it is more likely to be a previously unrecognised Roman road connecting the Roman towns at Dorchester on Thames and Dunstable.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation was undertaken by Cotswold  Archaeology in May 2015 at the request CGF Ltd at Kingston  Farm, Bradford-on-Avon. The earliest remains comprised a single  flint probably dropped by hunter-gatherers in the Mesolithic or Early  Neolithic periods. The earliest cut feature on site was a pit which  contained mammal bones, perhaps the remains of a feast, one of  which produced a Middle Bronze Age radiocarbon date. A small  assemblage of residual Middle Bronze Age pottery and Bronze Age  flints was recovered from later deposits, mostly in the vicinity of the  Bronze Age pit. The majority of features related to an Iron Age  settlement. This seems to have originated in the Early Iron Age  when several post-built structures were constructed within an open  settlement. These may have included granaries and a rectangular  building, perhaps a dwelling comparable to and contemporary with  a similar rectangular building found at Budbury Hillfort, 1.2km to the  west. These structures seem to have been deliberately dismantled  to allow for the establishment of a rectilinear ditched enclosure,  dateable to the Early to Middle Iron Age. Although this enclosure  contained only a few pits and postholes, the quantity of finds from  its fills suggests that it was the setting for occupation, although no  dwellings were identified. The latest phase of Iron Age activity also  dated to the Early to Middle Iron Age and comprised an enclosed  roundhouse settlement. Although this was only partially exposed  within the site, the settings of at least two roundhouses were found,  along with pits, all bounded by a curvilinear ditch. The alignment of  the latter seems to have influenced that of a boundary ditch set out  in the Early Roman period, although the function of the Roman  ditch is unclear as it was found along the very edge of the site.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The majority of the proposed pipeline route has been found to follow a turnpike road, established as such in the mid 18th century, within a wider hinterland of agricultural land utilised as such perhaps from as early as the Roman period, though a Mesolithic pit and stray finds of the Bronze Age have also been found in the study area. Towards the eastern extent of the proposed pipeline route, a boundary ditch, an enclosure, hut circle and post holes have been identified and are likely to be of Roman origin, and a Roman road may extend into the area. A possible early medieval large timber building has also been found in the vicinity. Friar's Walk, to the east of the proposed pipeline route has been suggested to indicate a medieval friary in the vicinity, and the route itself may lead to a river crossing close to the proposed pipeline route.   Features relating to a former railway line which ran within the southern part of the field north of Low Road and south of the River Derwent are likely to be directly impacted upon by the development. At the western extent of the proposed pipeline route, a quarrying complex had been established by 1866, of which the present Kirk Cross Quarry is a surviving trace.   This study has found that the proposed pipeline route would result in a limited impact on heritage significance in relation to the route of a former railway line. This level of impact may require further archaeological work prior to any groundworks occurring, dependent upon advice from Cumbria County Council's Historic Environment Team.   There remains the potential for further as-yet unknown remains to survive within the area of direct impact, south of the River Derwent and north of Low Road. This is based on the recent discovery of features of the Mesolithic and Roman eras and the potential for features relating to an early medieval large timber building and possible medieval friary  </value>

The works entailed the excavation in spits of between 0.6 and 2.4m of peat, across a 9.4 hectare site.  A total of five utilised tree throws, containing charcoal, animal bone and struck flint were found at the bottom of the archaeological sequence, underlying the peat. The struck flint assemblage included Mesolithic microliths   The project revealed that prior to the formation of the peat, the area was heavily forested. From the Late Neolithic onwards conditions gradually became wetter, turning first into Alder Carr fen woodland and eventually into a large body of water, potentially by the Late Bronze Age. The carbon dating could not elucidate this any further as a result of obligate water plants fixing ancient carbon from the chalk.  Within the upper part of the Alder Carr wood peat, evidence for beaver activity was identified with the recovery of beaver hewn wood, forming a lodge or food store.  Fragments of stone axe cut wood were also recovered from this deposit.  A post-medieval willow drain was found at the top of the archaeological sequence cutting into the underlying peat.</value>

Two Early Bronze Age urned cremations were buried in adjacent pits. There was no evidence for an associated funerary monument and nothing to indicate contemporary occupation in the immediate vicinity.    The earliest permanent occupation of the site probably occurred in the Late Iron Age/Early Roman period, and was represented by the insubstantial remains of a system of ditched enclosures and associated pitting. Food remains and other domestic waste suggest a settlement on or close to the site, although no evidence for dwellings or other structures was found.    In the Roman period four cremation burials (two urned, and two un-urned) took place in two different areas of the site. One of the un-urned burials included three Early Roman brooches that formed part of the pyre debris. One of the cremation urns included a flagon as an accessory vessel. There was no clear evidence for contemporary occupation, although a large pit located more than 100m east of the cremation burials contained fragments of Roman bricks and tiles, suggesting that there was a substantial building nearby.

The 2001 work revealed an array of Mesolithic tree-throws and purposefully dug pits, much Neolothic flintwork  as well as an important feature with placed deposits of up to six Peterborough Ware vessels.

The main focus of occupation identified during the excavations was  found to be between the 11th and 14th centuries, but there were indications that occupation  was evident from much earlier during the Anglo Saxon period from about the 6th century  AD. A large, possible medieval manor site was identified during the excavations as a  kitchen area was noted with a number of clay ovens, at least one structure, large storage  pits and possible further outbuildings and paddocks, as well as evidence for additional large  boundary ditches. The general absence of any post-14th century pottery certainly suggests that the site was abandoned at that time.  A number of residual worked flints were also excavated from across the site that hints at the  utilisation of the landscape between the Mesolithic and the Early Iron Age along the Stour  Valley and its tributaries, such as the Belchamp Brook.

Planning permission has been approved, subject to conditions including a programme of archaeological works.   The site comprises a number of fields to the south of Worcester, bounded to the north by Broomhall Way (A4440), to the south by Taylors Lane.  This phase investigated the eastern part of the development site intended for industrial and mixed use. An earlier phase of works was carried out in December 2017 on two Western fields that are intended for residential use.   Geotechnical works on the site required the excavation of Site Investigation Trial pits and Window Sampling. Archaeological assets on the southern edge of Worcester include a Mesolithic camp, an Iron Age and Roman settlement site, a scheduled medieval farm and the location of a civil war battle. Liaison with Aidan Smyth of Malvern District Council confirmed that a watching brief was appropriate mitigation.   In total 10 trial pits and 11 window samples were excavated over the site area of 6.8 Hectares.   All recorded deposits were related to natural processes, with residual finds of 18th to 20th century domestic pottery and ceramic building material recovered from the topsoil and subsoil. The recovered assemblage is typical of background scatter introduced to the site through a mixture of agricultural activity and casual domestic waste disposal and no significant archaeology was recorded during the works.

The test pit evidence was restricted to exposing the concrete footings of the present buildings and no archaeological layers were exposed. The borehole evidence was more positive, allowing a consistent tripartite 'site processes' model to be constructed. It was found that the chalk bedrock was overlain first by Pleistocene gravels; probably derived from flooding events of the nearby River Cray immediately to the east of the site. This in turn was overlain by Holocene alluviums in the form of a brick-earth, an old ground surface which was found to have been occupied in the Mesolithic period during an evaluation by PCA in 2015. A large quantity of struck flint-work was recovered from this surface. This current phase of the operation did not permit any open areas of excavation. Residual finds in the form of fragmentary tobacco pipe and CBM seemed to confirm the Post-medieval date for a trapped plough soil found in some areas of the site under the modern concrete surface. A single, broken Mesolithic flint blade was retrieved from a 'made ground' layer which had worked its way into the later layers through re-working and soil movement. </value>

The southernmost strip map and sample at Hethersett was located close to Hethersett Roman Villa site. Pits and ditches associated with Romano-British occupation (broadly dating to the 2nd century) were identified within the area. A small Bronze Age pit was also identified, hinting at unidentified prehistoric occupation.  The northernmost strip map and sample area was located to the south of All Saints Church, Little Melton. The main focus of the site was an area of Late Saxon and early medieval occupation. This included a multi-phase building, pits, ditches and a potential trackway. A series of agricultural features including ridge and furrow were also identified. At the southern end of the site a large ditch was associated with a moated manor site to the west of the Strip Map and Sample area. Finally, a mixed assemblage of struck flints dated from the Late Palaeolithic/Early Mesolithic onwards and a line of postholes of Romano-British date were also excavated.  The watching brief was largely devoid of archaeological features. The only area of note was a ploughed out multiphase flint scatter at the northern end of the pipeline in association with a burnt mound and Iron Age pottery.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeological evaluation at Land off Sandy Lane, Woodbridge, was undertaken in advance of determination of a planning application. The site straddled the dry- and wetland divide in this part of the Deben valley, marked by an east/west bank/scarp that bisected it. Part of the site had previously investigated within the East Anglia One cable route and had been subject to geophysical survey prior to this trial-trenching.   Archaeological features were recorded in 23 of the 29 excavated trenches, representing a low density/complexity scatter of remains across the site. A very small quantity of residual struck flint artefacts suggests some activity of Mesolithic to Early Neolithic date in the vicinity of the site. A single pit of later prehistoric date, a pit of late Iron Age or Roman date and a Roman ditch were also identified. However, much of the archaeological activity recorded was undated, and comprised pits, ditches, gullies and a single posthole. A short section of wall of AD1500 date was identified within the west of the site and a ditch containing CBM of the same date was located towards the east edge of the site.   Peat deposits within a possible palaeochannel, identified running roughly east to west across the south of the site demonstrated a good survival of waterlogged material and have a high potential to yield palaeoenvironmental remains.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of the archaeological excavation carried out by Archaeology South-East at the Bolnore Village Development (Phase 4), Bolnore, Haywards Heath, West Sussex between January and March 2011. The fieldwork was commissioned by Crest Nicholson (South) Limited.    The excavations revealed residual activity of the Mesolithic, Neolithic and late Iron Age/Roman periods as well as late post-medieval agricultural and allotment activity.     The majority of archaeological evidence encountered at the site however dates to the medieval period of the 11th to 13th centuries. This activity relates to the evolution of part of a Wealden manorial farmstead. This farmstead site has been shown to be a component of 'the Hayworth' and the 'lost' manor of Trubwick. Historical, archaeological, landscape and place name evidence has been utilised to set the activity in context and it seems probable that the site and the wider Hayworth may be related to a specialised cattle rearing or vaccary farm. As such it may be the first such example to be investigated in the South-East and may represent a type-site for the Wealden region.     The report is written and structured so as to conform to the standards required of post-excavation analysis work as set out in Management of Archaeological Projects 2 (Andrews 1991). Interim analysis of the stratigraphic, finds and environmental material has indicated a provisional chronology, and assessed the potential of the site archive to address the original research agenda, as well as assessing the significance of those findings. This has highlighted what further analysis work is required in order to enable suitable dissemination of the findings in a final publication.   </value>

The project was commissioned by Vanderbilt Homes in compliance with a planning condition attached to planning approval for the residential development of the site.    The site had previously been subject to a geophysical survey (Ladocha and Walford 2014) and archaeological trial trench evaluation (Finn 2015).  The latter encountered evidence of medieval tenement plot boundaries and field boundary ditches, respecting the alignment of Bishopstone Road, and contemporary quarrying activity.    In the event, the archaeological excavation of the site revealed an enclosed agricultural landscape dating between the Saxo-Norman and High medieval periods (11th to 13th/ 14th century AD).  This was preceded by scant evidence of Late Iron Age/ Romano-British activity, while struck flints of late Mesolithic/ early Neolithic character were present as residual material within later features/ contexts.  A few post-medieval and later features were also encountered.  The medieval site included the remains of four possible earth-fast structures (possibly animal pens) and a number of intercutting pit clusters, including probable quarry pits.  Finds from the site include an array of medieval tools, agricultural objects and items of personalia.  Of particular interest are a lead pilgrim flask and possible high-status items, including a worked bone plate thought to be from a stringed instrument.  Recovered animal bone and environmental remains suggest a mixed agricultural economy, focussing on sheep husbandry and the cultivation of wheat, food preparation and consumption.  Evidence for local iron production/ manufacture and cereal processing was also encountered, although these activities do not appear to have occurred within the excavated area.  </value>

Four boreholes were drilled on the Site, on an east-west aligned transect to the south of the Boat House.   The lower/earlier part of the sampled sequence, around 6.5-7m below ground level (bgl) consists of a relatively thick terrestrial soil (0.4m) of early Post-glacial date (9150-8790 cal. BC), which developed on an a slight gravel high, which is a likely relic of a Devensian braided channel system.The post-glacial to late Mesolithic alluvial deposits alternated between organic-rich and mineralogenic silts, representing well-vegetated channel margins and more open (although slowmoving) aquatic environments. These changes could be due to either fluctuations in water level or slight channel migration. Above these 3m of alluvial deposits, a thin peat layer (0.08m) at 3.4m bgl was dated to the late Mesolithic (6480-6390 cal. BC). Plant remains and pollen indicate that this formed within a alder carr wetland environment, similar to slightly earlier dated deposits at Testwood Lakes 6 miles to the west. Pollen shows that oak and hazel forests continue to dominate the drier parts of the valley. Sealing the thin late Mesolithic peat were around one metre of soft sticky alluvial deposits with abundant horizontal waterlogged reed remains (Phragmites).</value>

Romano-British activity included extensive field systems and pottery manufacture. The site also contained evidence for Anglo-Saxon occupation - an earlier dispersed settlement replaced by an enclosed settlement which continued into the 8th or 9th century. This settlement may have had a semi-official function and been related to Mercian expansion, based on its name 'Conington' (kings town) and the defensive nature of the enclosure.</value>

Twenty eight trenches were excavated.  Across the site, specifically concentrated between Trenches 8 and 25, a number of ditches, pits and tree throws were recorded. There is strong evidence for both Early Prehistoric and Late Roman activity. There were several tree throws recorded across the site, 1907 contained Mesolithic/Early Neolithic worked flint. This suggests possible early tree clearance within the Site. There were also a number of ditches, of which 1604, contained New Forest Colour-coated ware.

In addition the section extending along the northern and north eastern edge of the quarry containing significant peat and colluvium deposits was recorded and environmental samples taken. Prehistoric finds were limited to a small number of flints identified as of probable Mesolithic and early Bronze Age date. This is consistent with the low density noted during earlier field walking of Phase 8 North. More significant concentrations, arguably suggestive of the main focus of activity, were recovered from areas of higher ground to the south and east.  Three sherds of Romano-British courseware pottery, of likely local manufacture, were identified during the watching brief. The pottery was very abraded and recovered from the lower colluvial deposits suggesting that they may be associated with manuring the fields.  The archaeological remains comprised remnants of former medieval strip cultivation (ridge and furrow) and later field drainage.  The ridge and furrow formed part of a wider medieval landscape of open fields surrounding the village of Ashby Parva. No longer surviving as upstanding earthworks these took the form of truncated furrow bases.  A transect at the northern end of Phase 8 containing a peaty clay deposit was recorded. It had substantial layers of potential colluvial origin. No archaeological features or horizons were present, although a black humic peat layer was identified. The sedimentary sequence was broadly the same as that encountered during previous work within the quarry which determined that the formation of the peat occurred in the early post-glacial period. Environmental samples taken from the peat and colluvial deposits have been retained by TPA and may form the basis of a future research project.</value>

An archaeological intrusive evaluation carried out in July and August 2013 identified four concentrations of archaeological features (Feature Groups A to D). Further works were recommended involving open area strips centred on the feature groups, beginning with A. Works then began around B, which exposed an unusually high level of significant archaeological features. In response to this, the Archaeological Consultant (RSK) and WoSAS negotiated a Strip, Map and Sample exercise to test the surrounding landscape. The core objective was to elucidate the extent of features within the landscape surrounding the identified groups (B and C). Feature Group C was subsequently broken down into Areas 1, 2  and  3, where archaeological features seemingly related to agriculture, landscaping and land boundaries were encountered, in addition to a number of pits and post-holes, indicative of anthropic activity. While artefact presence was limited, finds from the site generally indicate a broad date range for activity, ranging from prehistoric to 20th century.   Area B was defined by stylised phases of boundary features enclosing an interior space. Excavations revealed evidence of ferrous metal-working and possibly nonferrous metal-working. Investigation revealed a high volume of stake-holes, pits and post-holes. Four enclosing curvilinear features, one post defined enclosure, and four large features seemingly representing entranceways were identified. Artefactual evidence indicates activity from Mesolithic although the majority represent late Bronze Age/Iron Age date.</value>

The trackway had been benched into the hillside and the parallel ditch had been excavated to protect it from water runoff. The Romano-British enclosure appears fairly similar to other known examples from within the region, with it being sub-square in plan and enclosing an area of c.3250m&amp;#178; and, although its purpose remains unclear, the apparently random internal linear features may represent the remains of a Roman period field system such as that excavated at Burgh-by-Sands and those associated with a similar ditched enclosure at Burgh Road, Carlisle.

Also uncovered was evidence of prehistoric settlement, which had been sealed by the colluvial deposits into which the Roman-period features had been excavated.

The evaluation yielded a small number of worked flints dating from between the Mesolithic and Iron Age. The first cut feature is a probable Early Neolithic pit or treethrow. These features are commonly found in conjunction with others, but no other examples were noted on site. A residual sherd of Early Neolithic pottery was, however, recovered from a later ditch.  There is then an apparent hiatus on site until the Middle Bronze Age from which an urned cremation and a pit containing the butchered remains of at least two horses was recorded. The cremation is comparable to other examples found during recent excavations at previous phases of work at Toddington Lane, while the pit containing faunal remains is a rarer and potentially important example of activity in the area.  Additional assemblages of Middle to Late Bronze Age pottery were recovered from some ditch elements and these might provide evidence of the first distinctive division of the landscape on site.  Another hiatus then occurs until the Late Iron Age to Early Roman period, when further ditches are excavated, possibly forming part of a boundary division or fieldscape.

The assessment was undertaken upon vibrocore samples from the export cable route and from boreholes in the wind farm area derived from two separate geotechnical surveys undertaken in 2010 and 2013 respectively.  The palaeoenvironmental assessment results were mixed. Whilst diatoms were absent from the assessed samples, some good assemblages of molluscs, plant remains, pollen, foraminifera and ostracods were recorded, with the best sequence investigated being from location BH-G01, which is located in the northern part of the proposed wind farm area. Radiocarbon dates obtained from the samples ranged from the Early Mesolithic to the post-medieval periods. The geoarchaeological interpretation from the two geotechnical surveys have also been combined into a deposit model taking into account both the archaeological interpretation of sub-bottom geophysical data from the site and information obtained from the British Geological Survey data. Whilst some interesting Mesolithic sequences have been assessed here, the samples are not deemed to be suitable for further Stage 4 analytical work.

<value columnNumber="1">Between May and August 2016, Archaeological Solutions Ltd carried out an archaeological excavation at land adjacent to the recreation ground, Bishopstone Road, Stone, Buckinghamshire.  The project was commissioned by Vanderbilt Homes in compliance with a planning condition attached to planning approval for the residential development of the site.    The site had previously been subject to a geophysical survey (Ladocha and Walford 2014) and archaeological trial trench evaluation (Finn 2015).  The latter encountered evidence of medieval tenement plot boundaries and field boundary ditches, respecting the alignment of Bishopstone Road, and contemporary quarrying activity.    In the event, the archaeological excavation of the site revealed an enclosed agricultural landscape dating between the Saxo-Norman and High medieval periods (11th to 13th/ 14th century AD).  This was preceded by scant evidence of late Romano-British activity, while struck flints of late Mesolithic/ early Neolithic character were present as residual material within later features/ contexts.  A few post-medieval and later features were also encountered.  The medieval site included the remains of four possible earth-fast structures (probably animal pens) and a number of intercutting pit clusters, including quarry pits.  Dispersed quarry pits were also identified.  Finds from the site include an array of medieval tools, agricultural objects and items of personalia.  Of particular interest are a lead pilgrim flask and possible high-status items, including a worked bone plate thought to be from a stringed instrument.  Recovered animal bone and environmental remains suggest a mixed agricultural economy, focussing on sheep husbandry and the cultivation of wheat, food preparation and consumption.  Evidence for local iron production/ manufacture and cereal processing was also encountered, although these activities do not appear to have occurred within the excavated area.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In order to explore the palaeoenvironmental potential of the site, as recommended in the evaluation report, subsamples were taken from one borehole (BBE18_BH02) for radiocarbon dating as well as pollen, plant macrofossil and ostracod assessments. These assessments have revealed a series of environmental changes spanning the middle and late Holocene.   Consistent with current geoarchaeological modelling, at the site location the floodplain was probably a stable, dry, gravelly topography with freshwater channels in the vicinity and a river terrace to the north. It was not probably until the later Mesolithic when river levels began to rise (as a knock on effect of relative sea level rise), that the area was flooded, depositing thin layers of alluvium. A slowing down or hiatus in sea level rise allowed vegetation to spread across the alluvial deposits which was recovered in the boreholes as peat. The peat indicated that, by the early Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, an alder carr woodland had formed at the site with mixed broadleaf woodland cover on the surrounding drylands. Conditions were wet initially, drying out over time. By the end of the Bronze Age, rising sea level led to the establishment of estuarine saltmarsh conditions at the site, which probably persisted throughout the historic period until the eventual development of the area.  This assessment has provided an outline of the changing palaeoenvironment of the site throughout the Holocene to create a more detailed picture of the changes suggested in the environmental assessment. However, the given ubiquity of the sediments in the local area, coupled with the moderate to poor nature of the preservation of the palaeoenvironmental material, no further work is recommended.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology in May 2015 at the request CGF Ltd at Kingston Farm, Bradford-on-Avon. The earliest remains comprised a single flint probably dropped by hunter-gatherers in the Mesolithic or Early Neolithic periods. The earliest cut feature on site was a pit which contained mammal bones, perhaps the remains of a feast, one of which produced a Middle Bronze Age radiocarbon date. A small assemblage of residual Middle Bronze Age pottery and Bronze Age flints was recovered from later deposits, mostly in the vicinity of the Bronze Age pit. The majority of features related to an Iron Age settlement. This seems to have originated in the Early Iron Age when several post-built structures were constructed within an open settlement. These may have included granaries and a rectangular building, perhaps a dwelling comparable to and contemporary with a similar rectangular building found at Budbury Hillfort, 1.2km to the west. These structures seem to have been deliberately dismantled to allow for the establishment of a rectilinear ditched enclosure, dateable to the Early to Middle Iron Age. Although this enclosure contained only a few pits and postholes, the quantity of finds from its fills suggests that it was the setting for occupation, although no dwellings were identified. The latest phase of Iron Age activity also dated to the Early to Middle Iron Age and comprised an enclosed roundhouse settlement. Although this was only partially exposed within the site, the settings of at least two roundhouses were found, along with pits, all bounded by a curvilinear ditch. The alignment of the latter seems to have influenced that of a boundary ditch set out in the Early Roman period, although the function of the Roman ditch is unclear as it was found along the very edge of the site.</value>

During this time, an impressive prehistoric monument complex was uncovered, comprising three Neolithic cursuses and a complete Late Neolithic hengiform. This ceremonial activity is bracketed by earlier in situ Upper Palaeolithic and Late Mesolithic flint scatters found in association with preserved buried soil horizons, and later Bronze Age occupation, consisting of coaxial field system ditches, a partial ring gully, burnt stone pits and isolated cremation deposits. Two Roman trackways and several probable Roman quarry pits and ditches were also revealed. Beneath the alluvial overburden, substantial networks of braided palaeochannel systems had carved the gravel terraces into 'islands', across which the prehistoric activity was located. The Roman features were cut from within the alluvial overburden, whilst post-Medieval trackways were recorded in the uppermost alluvial and topsoil layers.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The archaeological watching brief was focused on the excavation of five geotechnical test pits. In all of these, the natural, Beenham Grange Gravel member, was reached, although the presence of large amounts of groundwater in this deposit caused the test pits to collapse before reaching depth. In two of the test pits, this gravel was overlain by alluvial clays. The geotechnical test pits showed that there has been a large amount of disturbance across the site with the average depth of made ground recorded as 1.68 m below ground level and at its shallowest 1.40 m below ground level. This made ground either overlay the natural gravels or the alluvium where present. Piles and pipes were observed down to around 2.50 m below ground level. The presence of the undemolished Cedar House meant that a sixth geotechnical test pit could not be excavated.    No significant archaeological features, artefacts or ecofacts were revealed during this watching brief. It appears that substantial disturbance to the site occurred during the 20th century, probably associated with the construction of Newbury Magistrates' Court. The presence of alluvial clay and natural gravels indicates that there is potential for Upper Palaeolithic or Mesolithic archaeology to survive within this area, but none was observed.    </value>

The evaluation was undertaken following a request from the Derbyshire County Council Planning Archaeologist, to assess the archaeological potential of the site in line with paragraph 128 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The evaluation comprised a shovel pit survey, with 183 pits excavated on a grid at 10m intervals. The shovel pit methodology was designed to assess the potential for the continuation of earlier prehistoric artefact scatters previously identified within the vicinity of the site, as well as later mining activity.  In general the topsoil and subsoil deposits across the site remained fairly consistent, with slight localised variation. Few artefacts were recovered from any of the pits, and those that were did not indicate any specific distribution pattern. The results of the evaluation suggest that there is a low potential for the presence of Mesolithic to Neolithic flint working within the site; only one worked flint was recovered. The remainder of the artefacts recovered were all post-medieval in origin, and of low/negligible archaeological significance.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation was undertaken in November 2015 at land to the rear of Church Row  in Gretton, Gloucestershire.It was  commissioned by CgMs Consulting acting on behalf of Spitfire Properties LLP, with the site under  consideration for residential development.  Six trenches of varying length were excavated in a broad array across the field, which was known  from preceding site walkover and geophysical survey to have extant but denuded ridge and furrow  agricultural remains. The trenches included one positioned to examine the possibility of survival of  any archaeological features beneath a ridge of the ridge and furrow cultivation and another  targeted on a linear geophysical anomaly.  Across the trenches the archaeological remains observed suggest that this site occupies an area  of land previously used for mostly rural agricultural activity, with little indication of direct settlement  due to the lack of features and the relative absence of cultural material remains from any period.  The typically domestic medieval and later pottery finds, found in the upper deposits across the  trenches, are likely to relate to this agriculture. An undated pit did contain evidence of burnt  remains however, in the form of burnt bone and charcoal, but no in-situ burning. The calcined bone  recovered could suggest that this was the residue of a cremation deposit. An undated linear was  also identified, found in association with struck flint and possible rooting, suggesting that there may  be a background scatter of prehistoric activity across the area. The small lithic scatter, found  disturbed in the subsoil, was technologically characteristic of the later Mesolithic or early Neolithic  period, and is of considerable interest.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation was undertaken at St Ann's Heath School, Virginia Water in advance of the construction of a proposed residential development on part of the original school playing field. It produced significant evidence of occupation for the early to middle Iron Age, as well as evidence for activity during the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age and post-medieval periods. Alongside excavation work conducted on the nearby new school playing field, the information acquired overall indicates a nationally important site, showing  evidence of late prehistoric activity in an area where little had been previously identified. Also, the earlier Iron Age period is widely recognised as being poorly understood in comparison to the later period, giving weight to the significance of this site.  </value>

The work was undertaken between the  8th and the 16th December 2011 and was commissioned by  CgMs Consulting on behalf of their client Sainsburys. Thirty  evaluation trenches, each measuring 30 metres in length, were  excavated. The site produced a small Mesolithic and/or Neolithic  'background' of flintwork likely to represent transient activity in  the area rather than any in situ activity. There is a focus of  Romano-British activity in the south-east part of the site and the  potential that further remains of this date survive in this area.  The remains suggest that the site was used for agricultural  purposes with the remains of a ditched field system and possible  ditched- track way excavated. The features are commensurate  with those found on the outskirts of a nucleated or higher-status  settlement with a focus of activity between c. AD40-80 and  continuing albeit to a lesser degree into the 3rd century AD. Two  rubbish pits indicate that there is also a Saxo-Norman presence  in the area.</value>

In addition, the results from an assessment of specific groups of artefacts have been considered and incorporated into this report.   The analysis identified three broad periods of landscape use in the Cutacre area. The earliest of these was identified at Cinder Hill and is prehistoric in date.

<value columnNumber="1">NPS Archaeology carried out archaeological works before construction of a multi-storey car park at land off Rose Lane and Mountergate in Norwich.  Archaeological evaluation demonstrated human activity of late prehistoric to modern date. Subsequent excavation examined two areas of 4.00m x 13.00m and 5.00m x 7.00m.  The earliest evidence of human activity comprised c.300 worked flints, including axe-sharpening debris and typologically dated as Mesolithic-Early Neolithic. Soil micromorphology identified a relic soil containing most lithics as overlain by up cast material, this up cast tentatively dated as Middle to Late Anglo-Saxon.   The evaluation recorded 10th and 11th-century activity in the north-west of the site on slightly rising ground near the posited location of St Vedast, thought a pre-conquest church. The evaluation also identified a probable north-south road of 12th-14th-century date in the north-west of the site.   Ceramic dating suggests the site flourished in the 14th-16th centuries, its location on low-lying land close to the River Wensum significant for the activities taking place. The presence of two nearby medieval friaries might have influenced this activity.    Evidence of medieval industries thought to be associated with leather, parchment production or perhaps horn working are suggested by a nationally important collection of goat-horn cores from the site. Isotope analysis of goat phalanges suggests sampled animals were raised in north-west Europe, perhaps locally.    Widespread medieval activity was characterised by pits with goat horn cores in areas with chalk or clay floors. The recovery of probable medieval pottery kiln debris suggests other industries at the site.     Activity declines from the 16th century, and deep post-medieval soils sealed earlier remains.   After this little seems to have occurred at the site until the 19th and 20th centuries, when a fish market and a Boulton and Paul ironmongery factory were established.  </value>

The presence of a preserved Mesolithic soil horizon was established but its extent unable to be established.    The earliest feature dated to the Late Bronze Age and contained a ceramic vessel, possibly a structured deposit. An unusually high concentration of Middle to Late Bronze Age bronze beads were also recovered.    A small quantity of Early Iron Age material was recovered and an apparent hiatus in Middle Iron Age activity recorded.    Evidence for a high status Late Iron Age settlement was uncovered with an assemblage of brooches and coins dating. Cut features relating to this phase include a well and large ditch. The dimensions of this ditch are similar to the Chichester entrenchments but any association is unclear.    The Early Roman period, between AD50 and AD120 saw a marked increase in activity. The conception and construction of a nucleated settlement formed of ditches, enclosures and associated metalled roads was undertaken on a seemingly planned system. Activities include iron smithing, grain processing, butchery of livestock, use of fish, animal husbandry and trade. The extent to which these activities are industrial or domestic is unclear. Features revealed include boundary ditches, metalled roads, a bowl furnace, refuse pits, postholes and beam slots. A preserved Roman soil horizon was revealed across half the site demonstrating good preservation. A large quantity of pottery and animal bone and coins were recovered as were brooches, glass, mirror fragments, finger rings, tweezers and a key demonstrating a wealthy settlement.    Activity reduces during the Middle Roman period and has almost ceased by the end of the Roman period, but the processes on site appear to be similar to its forbears. One possible exception is a structure foundation trench.  </value>

Evidence of heavily truncated ridge and furrow agriculture was evident, while one heavily truncated pit base yielded charcoal fragments which were radiocarbon dated to the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition (4173-3987 cal BC). A 100% watching brief was carried out from 19-25th January 2017 and three further features were recorded, the bases of two post-holes and the base of a pit or hearth filled with charcoal.  One post-hole base contained a Late Neolithic flint blade but insufficient dating material was recovered from either posthole to produce a radiocarbon date. The charcoal and burnt bone recovered from the hearth produced a radiocarbon date of the Late Neolithic period (charcoal 2821-2631 calBC; bone 2906-2859 calBC).  Although these features do not allow for much interpretation due to their fragmentary condition and contents, activity at the site included hearths in use on the site in the Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic period as well as the later Neolithic and this adds to the sites of this period known from the rich surrounding area.  </value>

This collection contained a relatively high frequency of bladelets and platform cores, with a variety of retouched pieces including notches, scrapers, awls and burins. The assemblage as a whole appeared likely to be Mesolithic, although other than a microburin and a backed bladelet there was no evident microlithic component. A barbed and tanged point indicated a later prehistoric presence. Having shown the collection to Prof Steven Mithen and Dr Karen Wicks, both based at the University of Reading, subsequent seasons of fieldwork have been carried out in the back garden in 2006, 2010 and 2014 funded by the University of Reading and Historic Scotland.    Excavations have shown that below the topsoil there was a complex series of inter-cutting and truncated features containing Mesolithic artefacts that had been heavily disturbed by recent cultivation within the garden.  Substantial hearth-like features set within a circular arrangement of probable post-holes and stake holes indicate the presence of a hut. Radiocarbon dates obtained during 2006 and 2010 indicate an initial phase of activity associated with the Mesolithic artefacts dating to c. 10,300 cal BP, followed by a second phase possibly associated with the use of the hut c. 1000 years later.   </value>

Sediment recovery was good in two of the three window samples. Below made ground/piling mat, medieval to post-medieval sandy clays and the Anglo-Saxon organic fills of a ditch/water course were found to exist up to 0.8m in thickness across the site, over possible 7m thickness of Trafalgar Square Sands and Silts complex, possibly reworked by a water course during the early Mesolithic.  The potential geoarchaeological interest on the site was in the Pleistocene interglacial and Holocene palaeo-environmental data, and the area of proposed development had potential to contain information on local and regional environmental change in the Pleistocene and Holocene, in terms of vegetation, sea-level change, and human exploitation of environments. However, due to the apparent Mesolithic reworking of the Trafalgar Square Sands and Silts and poor preservation of the palaeoenvironmental remains in the dated Mesolithic and the Anglo-Saxon deposits the site is considered to have little or no further geoarchaeological potential.

Two areas, covering a total of 0.7ha were opened. Area A was situated to the north of the partition wall that subdivided the development area whilst Area B lay to its south. Evidence for human activity spanning the Mesolithic to Medieval periods was recovered, although features directly associated with settlement appeared to date predominantly to the Iron Age and were concentrated toward the southern end of Area B. These comprised boundary ditches and gullies, pits and a very large number of postholes, some of which were concentrated into clusters that appeared to represent the sites of repeated construction, probably of fairly temporary structures. Three cremations dating to the Middle Bronze Age were recorded in Area A. Two inhumations also recovered from Area A were tentatively dated to the Roman period. A number of sherds of Saxon pottery were recorded across the site but of particular significance was the recovery of a sherd of imported North French Blackware. This was an extremely rare find in the county, with Chatteris being just the third site to produce such material.

<value columnNumber="1">A program of deposit modelling and palaeoenvironmental assessment revealed a sequence of Late Devensian Shepperton Gravel overlain by a sequence of Holocene alluvial sediments, including peat, buried beneath modern Made Ground. The relief of the Shepperton Gravel is suggestive of a possible Late Devensian/Early Holocene channel, the main axis of which is probably located towards the western area of the site, and which may have been aligned broadly north-south. In general, greater thicknesses of both Peat and the combined Holocene alluvial deposits are recorded within the confines of the possible former channel. Peat accumulation began at the site during the Late Mesolithic continuing until the Bronze Age. The results of the assessment of the peat are indicative of a peat surface dominated by alder, with an understorey of sedges and occasional grasses and aquatics. Hazel, ash and birch may have occupied the peat surface with alder, but are more likely to grown on the dryland forming mixed deciduous woodland with oak and lime. Although there is no definitive evidence for human activity in the sequence, evidence for a decline in oak and lime towards the top of the sequence provide possible evidence for human impact on the landscape during the late prehistoric period. Analysis is recommended on the pollen and seed assemblage in the sequence from borehole LCY-BHAC03, along with two additional radiocarbon dates to provide a better chronological framework. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological watching brief was carried out in advance of improvement works to the existing A9 road at the Berriedale Braes, Caithness. The works followed on from an archaeological evaluation in 2017 that comprised a trial-trenching evaluation and a hand-excavated evaluation of a post-medieval byre structure. The watching brief entailed the monitoring of the demolition of the byre structure and a topsoil strip of the surrounding area to determine if any additional archaeological features survived in the area, to ensure that all archaeological deposits related to this structure were recorded.    Fieldwork was carried out from 13th to 17th August 2018. Ground clearance and dismantling of the post-medieval building was monitored and no further archaeological discoveries were made relating to it.    During the watching brief, visual inspection of recent unmonitored ground disturbance outwith the trial trenching area but within the development area identified prehistoric lithics. A series of test pits were excavated in order to ascertain the extent of the lithic spread. Initial cursory identification of these lithics suggest they could be Bronze Age/Neolithic in date, or potentially Mesolithic. It is recommended that further archaeological fieldwork be carried out to allow greater understanding of the site and further recovery of artefacts before the ground works commence for improvements to the road.  </value>

WSM 33906). Three trenches were excavated, revealing that the medieval ridge and furrow earthworks visible on the north side of the site had been filled in and levelled in the late 20th century when the site was part of a larger recreation area. The ridge and furrow truncated the natural clay matrix to the south. To the north, toward the River Avon, a deep alluvial subsoil contained frequent abraded Roman pottery, occasional medieval pottery, a small quantity of butchered bone, and worked flint. A single small burning pit cut into the clay was sealed by the subsoil toward the riverbank. It contained tiny fragments of indeterminate possible Neolithic, Bronze or Iron Age pottery, worked flint potentially of Mesolithic, early Neolithic or Bronze Age date, pot-boilers and environmental material. It is conjectured to have been a cooking pit. The fuel used may represent burning of general food waste No other features were identified, although similar unstratified finds indicate that further activity of similar date may exist in the immediate vicinity.</value>

St Helen's Church appears to have Saxon origins, though the present building dates to the 13th century. The site, centred at NGR TL 17664 14020, lies in the churchyard to the north of the church. The present church building dates to the 13th century but there is evidence to suggest that there has been a church on this site since at least the late Saxon period. Previous archaeological investigations within the graveyard to the north of the building have found evidence for Mesolithic occupation and for human remains of mid-late Saxon to 19th century date.   The groundworks for the present project were located on the northern side of the church and within the graveyard, in areas that had been disturbed in the recent past by the insertion of services. However, whilst the present works covered a large area, they were very limited in depth and only the top of the cemetery soil was impacted. As a result, no archaeological features, deposits or finds were encountered during the present project.</value>

The scheme is a continuation of previous work carried out at Ash Green Lane in January 2016 (BAL 2016).  Although no archaeological features were present, the finds recovered suggested activity in the area from the Mesolithic or early Neolithic, through the Romano-British and medieval to the post-medieval periods. However, no evidence for occupation, with the exception of post-medieval building rubble from Fields 1, 2, 3 and 6, was identified.  The late medieval pottery recovered from the topsoil/subsoil interface in Field 1 may derive from a pottery manufacturing centre identified in 1969 some 400m W of the pipeline route. The wide scatter of material may suggest that a number of small kilns were present, utilising the marginal wooded conditions known to have existed in this area during the medieval period.  No evidence was found for the burial activity relating to the prehistoric or Anglo-Saxon skeletons excavated in the 1930s and which were thought to have lain at the southern end of the pipeline route.</value>

Three features, two parallel ditches and a pit were identified cut into the top of the alluvium. These are most likely of contemporary date and ditch [4/003] contained a find of Late Iron Age/early Roman pottery. The ditches are likely to be field boundary ditches or a droveway indicative of an agricultural land-use.     Other periods are solely represented by finds of a residual Mesolithic/Neolithic flintwork piece and a single sherd of medieval pottery.    The geoarchaeological investigations proved that the site can be considered to exist on the margins of the Willingdon Levels coastal marsh system, the site therefore has always been on the western flank of the inlet system.     The geoarchaeological investigations have characterised the site as representing an area of relatively high- free draining land on the margins of the coastal marshes of the Willingdon levels which were subjected to alluvial over-bank deposits at a relatively late stage relative to the rest of the marshes. They may therefore have represented an area of relatively dry land close to important salt marsh and estuarine resources in Late Prehistory.  </value>

Residual worked flint and occasional pottery fragments of generally Mesolithic to Early Bronze Age date provides evidence for a limited and perhaps transitory prehistoric presence in the landscape. A small number of undated pits with charcoal-rich deposits and signs of in situ burning, interpreted as fire pits/hearths, may have been related to prehistoric land use. A small quantity of heavily abraded, residual Roman pottery was suggestive of Roman land use in the wider landscape. Features within Area 2, in the south-west of the site, have been tentatively dated to the Late Saxon period. The similarly orientated ditches are suggestive of the division/enclosure of the landscape, whilst several short, parallel gullies, postholes and clusters of pits are suggestive of a focus of occupation, such as a small farmstead, possibly constituting the remains of a building and indicative of associated outlying activity. Limited post-medieval/modern remains, comprising field boundary ditches, an animal burial pit and a possible quarry pit, are indicative of agricultural use of the landscape.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">NPS Archaeology carried out archaeological works before construction of a multi-storey car park at land off Rose Lane and Mountergate in Norwich.    Archaeological evaluation demonstrated human activity of late prehistoric to modern date. Subsequent excavation examined two areas of 4.00m x 13.00m and 5.00m x 7.00m.   The earliest evidence of human activity comprised c.300 worked flints, including axe-sharpening debris and typologically dated as Mesolithic-Early Neolithic. Soil micromorphology identified a relic soil containing most lithics as overlain by up cast material, this up cast tentatively dated as Middle to Late Anglo-Saxon.    The evaluation recorded 10th and 11th-century activity in the north-west of the site on slightly rising ground near the posited location of St Vedast, thought a pre-conquest church. The evaluation also identified a probable north-south road of 12th-14th-century date in the north-west of the site.     Ceramic dating suggests the site flourished in the 14th-16th centuries, its location on low-lying land close to the River Wensum significant for the activities taking place. The presence of two nearby medieval friaries might have influenced this activity.    Evidence of medieval industries thought to be associated with leather, parchment production or perhaps horn working are suggested by a nationally important collection of goat-horn cores from the site. Isotope analysis of goat phalanges suggests sampled animals were raised in north-west Europe, perhaps locally.    Widespread medieval activity was characterised by pits with goat horn cores in areas with chalk or clay floors. The recovery of probable medieval pottery kiln debris suggests other industries at the site.     Activity declines from the 16th century, and deep post-medieval soils sealed earlier remains.   After this little seems to have occurred at the site until the 19th and 20th centuries, when a fish market and a Boulton and Paul ironmongery factory were established.  </value>

The construction of the railway in the later 19th century led to the demolition of one farmhouse and its associated farm buildings.      This assessment suggests that the proposal site lies in an area of little known archaeological evidence, on land which was largely agricultural fields until its conversion into a golf course and holiday complex in the later twentieth century. It is evident that the countryside around the site was utilised quite intensively for military purposes during the Second World War and the HER data suggests that area N of the US assault training centre may have included the south western part of the site. The only archaeological features recorded on the Devon HER within 1km of the site dating prior to the medieval period in this area are a scatter of worked flints dating from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age and an earthwork, possibly an iron age enclosure or hill fort, both located to the south-west.      The archaeological potential for much this site is considered to be low to moderate, with a limited potential for encountering prehistoric archaeological remains and a moderate potential at the western end of the site to encounter medieval and post-medieval buildings and activity in the area of the extant buildings, which may have historically extended further to the south of the present settlement.     The railway line and 20th century leisure uses of the site have likely resulted in some areas of significant landscaping and truncation, but this appears to have been relatively localised.  </value>

Geophysical survey had identified a pattern of ridge and furrow throughout the field, and other possible archaeological anomalies.  Low level prehistoric activity ranging from the Mesolithic to the Bronze age was evidenced in flints found in plough soils and abraded pottery sherds found in later features. A possible watering hole or natural hollow contained part of a Samian plate and Early Iron Age sherds but the date and nature of the feature were uncertain.  Throughout the site was a system of small agricultural ditches or gullies of potentially Roman or Medieval date, surviving in various conditions according to the level of ploughing in each field.  The system was overlain by the later Medieval to post-Medieval system, including a headland running through the site with extensive ridge and furrow cultivation.

Four samples were analysed for molluscan remains and pollen analysis was undertaken on eight  samples. Pollen was present in good quantities in six of the eight samples. Both the molluscs and  the pollen were in agreement that swampy conditions gave way to slow flowing, but well  oxygenated water. In addition, the pollen evidence revealed a treeless, grassland environment,  with patches of willow and juniper scrub low down in the profiles. Such an environment is not  dissimilar from a modern alpine environment. Over time, pine, birch and hazel colonised the wider  area, but were not likely to have grown at the site. The site is typical of the late glacial/early  Holocene, showing a change from an open treeless landscape, to one where trees needing a  warmer climate began to colonise the area.  Two samples submitted for radiocarbon dating produced dates from the terminal Upper  Palaeolithic (10428-10015 cal BC) and the early Mesolithic 9356-9252 cal BC, consistent with the  late glacial/early Holocene transition as interpreted from the environmental evidence.  The site of is regional importance, as sites dating to this period are extremely rare within the county  and the West Midlands as a whole. The sequences from Abbey Bridge, therefore, have the  potential to improve and refine our understanding of the vegetational history of the Avon valley and  its surrounding area.</value>

It was re-cut in the Late Iron Age/early Romano_British period and its orientation changed to form straighter, perhaps co-axial field divisions. Light Medieval activity was present with a single ditch containing a cache of 12th century pottery. Finally, the third phase of activity in the south of the site uncovered the north wall of the north wing of Ember Court. The base foundation courses appear to have dated to the Tudor period with repairs, re-builds and the addition of buttresses occurring in the later 18th-19th centuries. The evolving formal gardens around the house recorded during the map regression exercise was confirmed through excavation.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The site produced an insignificant amount of prehistoric worked flint, all of which was residual in later features. One blade-like flake hints at transitory use of this area during the Mesolithic or Early Neolithic period.    The earliest evidence for settlement in the site area was a pit containing unabraded Late Bronze Age pottery, and a nearby ditch that might have been contemporary with the pit.    Two adjacent and intercutting ditches, perhaps part of a shifting field boundary, produced a small amount of Late Iron Age/Early Roman pottery.    A possible medieval building was represented by part of a probable beam slot and associated drip gully, the latter containing 14th-century pottery. A more substantial timber building incorporating brick elements, within a ditched enclosure, was constructed in the late 15th to 16th century. This probably marked the beginning of sustained occupation of the site and the origins of a roadside property known in the 19th century as Boarded Barns Farm.    During the post-medieval period, additional farm buildings were constructed and modifications were made to the farm complex and surrounding yards, gardens and fields.     At the end of the 19th century, Boarded Barns Farm was demolished and its site was partially occupied by new cottages. Other parts of the farm complex were landscaped and returned to cultivation.  </value>

The scheme is a continuation of previous work carried out at Ash Green Lane in January 2016 (BAL 2016).  Although no archaeological features were present, the finds recovered suggested activity in the area from the Mesolithic or early Neolithic, through the Romano-British and medieval to the post-medieval periods.

The late medieval pottery recovered from the topsoil/subsoil interface in Field 1 may derive from a pottery manufacturing centre identified in 1969 some 400m W of the pipeline route. The wide scatter of material may suggest that a number of small kilns were present, utilising the marginal wooded conditions known to have existed in this area during the medieval period.

During excavation, a number of Mesolithic flint tools were recovered, often from the interface with the underlying brick-earth geology. However, they were mainly in residual contexts or had been moved from their original positions due to hill-wash and soil creep. A SW to NE aligned linear had been detected on a LiDAR survey and this was picked up in two trenches. It was interpreted as a prehistoric boundary ditch with a flattened 'U' profile. Finds included both struck and burnt flint but no pottery or other dating material. On higher ground to the east a burnt layer was uncovered in Trench 5. A large quantity of burnt flint fragments and several struck flint flakes were recovered, suggesting a Bronze Age to Iron Age date. The burnt area may be a feature, hearth remnant or potential burnt mound. Finally, a number of the trenches showed a profile through the lake edge which revealed  that there was little in the construction save for the utilisation of the natural fall of the valley. Trench 4 detected what may have been a clay lining but this was absent in the other profiles. The in-filling of the lake with building materials (containing contaminated material) was the result of the creation of  a 20th century golf course and prohibited further excavation in some cases.</value>

The Late Bronze Age saw a dramatic increase in activity on site intense activity taking place in isolated pockets of the site as well as the digging of large linears again isolated from other features. A rectilinear enclosure was also recorded close to an area of pitting, probably for quarrying and for storage.    The main focus of the Bronze Age activity was in the east of the site where a number of post built structures were recorded, while some of these appear to have been used for cereal storage and processing others are may have ritual functions given the presence of three barrows on site.    While the Iron Age saw less activity on site, what there was appeared to respect much of the Bronze Age landscape; similarly aligned features and continuation of pitting were present in some areas.     The prehistoric activity as a whole also highlighted the frequent mirroring of the alignment of the Roman road Stane Street, with both Bronze Age and Iron Age features on this alignment or perpendicular to it suggesting the road may follow the line of an older trackway.    The Roman period saw surprisingly little activity given the proximity of the road; only a few sherds of pottery from a colluvial deposit were retrieved. The colluvium appears to have been deposited in two main phases with all features cut through the lower colluvium while the upper deposit overlay the Bronze Age and Iron Age features and may be of Roman date.    The post-medieval and modern activity was limited to 19th or 20th century field boundaries and post-war made ground.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Wessex Archaeology was commissioned by Redbourn Group Limited and NJL Consulting, on behalf of PIL (Newbury) Ltd, to undertake an archaeological evaluation of land currently occupied by The Narrow Boat public house, London Road, Newbury.    The evaluation, comprising two trial trenches located to coincide with the main proposed development footprint of a proposed new retail unit.  The principal findings of the evaluation related to the use of a former channel of the River Kennet, as shown on late 18th-19th century maps, prior to it becoming infilled and built over during the late 19th / early 20th century.     A series of floodplain / alluvial layers, overlain by relatively recent anthropogenic deposits, were recorded. The remains of a wooden boat were partially exposed within Trench 2, along with a row of timber posts or stakes. These were physically associated with thickly accumulated fine grained material laid down by the former river channel.     The boat is of local significance as an example of 18th/19th century vernacular rivercraft, and its discovery adds to existing knowledge of the types of small work boats, which were used, presumably in considerable numbers, alongside the larger barges and narrow boats at this time. Given its proximity to the Narrow Boat public house (formerly known as The White House), and the building shown in the same position on the 1780 enclosure map, the post alignment may have formed part of a jetty or wharf used by the owners and occupiers of the property, or part of a revetment of the river bank.     No evidence of activity pre-dating the 19th century was revealed during the evaluation. No evidence for Late Upper Palaeolithic / Mesolithic activity within the evaluated area was revealed and is consistent with the results of previous investigations carried out immediately to the east and west of the site.</value>

Although no prehistoric features were identified, an assemblage of 130 struck/worked later Mesolithic flints indicated that activity had taken place in the vicinity of the site. The earliest features in the 3 trenches were a series of narrow and shallow linear cuts interpreted as Iron Age field or enclosure ditches. Several undated pits are also likely to be Iron Age or Roman. No Roman burials or cremations were found, although other Roman features included 4 boundary or drainage ditches in Trenches 2 and 4. A further 3 probable Anglo-Saxon flat graves were found - including a male 'warrior' weapon burial. Unforeseen, was the discovery of an intact early 7th century chamber grave in Trench 1 at the S end of the site. The timber lining of the burial pit and the roof timbers which supported the earth mound had completely decayed. The preservation of the majority of the grave goods in their original positions can be attributed to the slow decay of the roof timbers that allowed soil from the mound to slowly percolate into the chamber. The grave goods included personal equipment and possessions, including 4 copper-alloy vessels still hanging on hooks on the chamber walls, weapons and regalia. Although the coffin and the body had decayed - tiny pieces of human tooth enamel were found during the environmental processing of a sample from the W end of the coffin. The coffin contained 2 small gold-foil Latin crosses from the head area, 2 gold coins, both tremisses from Merovingian France, a gold belt buckle that could have served as a reliquary, and 2 copper alloy shoe buckles. This lavishly equipped chamber grave, containing a princely burial with unequivocal Christian symbols, is one of the most significant Anglo-Saxon graves to have been discovered since the 1939 excavation of Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo. </value>

The vicinity of Malham Tarn is  nationally recognised as a centre of Mesolithic and later prehistoric activity, and some  small-scale trial trenching undertaken at the north end of the proposed route revealed  Mesolithic remains (Mark Newman).

Evidence of human activity was recorded from the medieval period through to the early 20th century. A small assemblage of Mesolithic flint work was the earliest evidence of human activity, although this was residual. The earliest phase of occupation was dated to the mid to late 13th century when the Site appears to have been divided into burgage plots and a possible post-built structure was erected. This was followed by an intensive period of iron working in the 14th and early 15th century, which appears to have been undertaken on, or close to the Site.  Numerous large pits were dated to this period, which had all been filled with large quantities of iron working slag.  A large well was also sunk at the rear of the plot, presumably to provide water for the industrial activities. Only one archaeological feature was dated to the later medieval, or Early Post-medieval period, a large cesspit containing an assemblage of late 15th to early 16th century pottery, copper alloy pins and a German jetton. The Site was a focus of activity from the early 18th century, with at least one structure recorded and numerous rubbish pits. A large assemblage of unstratified 19th century pottery was recovered from overburden deposits. The archaeological results reflected the development of Crawley, beginning as a thriving medieval ironworking centre, followed by decline in the 16th-17th centuries and its eventual development as an important coaching and then railway town in the late 18th-19th centuries. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">  The oldest material encountered at the site consisted of a thin scatter of prehistoric flintwork recovered mostly from the overburden. Some of the material appears to be Mesolithic/Neolithic in date and is probably indicative of transient hunter/gatherer activity rather than sedentary agriculture or settlement.    A thin scatter of mostly charcoal-rich pits was encountered in Area A, dated to the Middle to Late Iron Age on the basis of C14 dating. However the first tangible changes to the landscape occurred in the early Romano-British period when a ditched enclosure was established in Area B overlooking a valley to the north. Material recovered from the enclosure suggests that an iron producing bloomery furnace or furnaces were in operation in the vicinity in the first and second centuries AD, although the actual furnace(s) lay outside of the site boundary. A further short stretch of gully of a similar date was encountered at the eastern edge of Area A.    Area A was divided by a field boundary at some time in the medieval or early post-medieval period, and this boundary survived until the excavation of minepits for the extraction of iron ore, which clearly respect its alignment. These workings probably relate to the Heathfield Furnace complex, which lies c.2km to the north-east and was in operation between the 1690s and 1790s.    The minepits were encountered in both of the excavated areas, and showed some localised variation in distribution and character, notably on either side of the fields boundary in Area A, and in clusters of pits marked by a different methodology of excavation resulting in a distinctly dissimilar plan to the other minepits. Two hearths for roasting ore were presumed to date from this period, possible evidence of on-site quality control of the excavated ore.  </value>

The excavation followed on from an archaeological evaluation which had identified Bronze Age postholes, pits and occupation layers.    The archaeological investigations found that the earliest deposit on site was Seaford and Newhaven formation chalk bedrock, overlain by Thanet Beds. A brickearth layer was present in the central part of the site and variations in the natural geology suggested a valley occupied this part of the site.     A large assemblage of prehistoric struck flint was collected during the archaeological investigations and indicates prehistoric activity occurring over a long period of time. A colluvial layer produced evidence of early activity on or near to the site, activity which commenced during the Mesolithic and continued into the Early Bronze Age. The early prehistoric activity most likely reflects transient hunter-gatherer groups occasionally visiting the site. The later prehistoric periods, specifically the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age, represented the main phase of activity on site and the lithic assemblages suggest that later prehistoric settlement and agricultural activity occurred near to the site.     A number of pits broadly attributed to the Late Iron Age-Romano-British period, a Saxon pit, a number of undated pits and a colluvial deposit represented later activity on site, with the general absence suggesting that the site was only occasionally used from the end of the prehistoric period, through to the modern era.  </value>

The site is owned by Kingston Borough  Council and leased to the 6th Tolworth Scouts and Yorda Adventures (a support group for children with disabilities).The project was successful in involving a wide sector of the local community investigating their past, and learning new skills through  archaeological fieldwork. A range of finds relating to the post medieval and modern use of the site, were recovered and the borehole survey showed that deeply stratified fluvial and colluvial deposits were present within the investigation area. Radiocarbon dates from the lower part of the alluvial sequence dated to the Early Mesolithic period, indicating that much of the Holocene history of the Hogsmill River was preserved within these deposits. These show the movement of the river over time, changes in flow, and influence of human activity in the local area. Further work analysing the pollen, plant macrofossils, and molluscs from the sequence is recommended. The possibility for further projects in the area is also raised, if funding can be found. The results of the fieldwork were to be presented in an exhibition at Kingston Museum in 2012.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">In October 2017 Archaeological Research Services Ltd was commissioned by Tarmac to undertake an archaeological sample excavation of a kettle hole (KB5) as part of the enabling works for Killerby sand and gravel quarry. The site is located immediately east of the A1M trunk road, North Yorkshire, south of Catterick. The excavation targeted a kettle hole that had previously been identified and mapped by ARS Ltd and labelled 'KB5' by this project (Passmore 2012). It lies beneath the route of the quarry's intended haul road and it was therefore necessary to investigate the feature and its deposit sequence prior to the road's installation. A smaller kettle hole, 'KB15', is located c.17m the north-west of 'KB5'. This feature was also investigated and sampled as part of this phase of archaeological works via a single machine-excavated evaluation trench through its centre.   Excavation of kettle hole KB5 at Killerby revealed a complex deposit sequence spanning the end of the last major Ice Age (the Devensian) to the modern period. While the geoarchaeological sequence and palaeoenvironmental analysis of the deposits has provided vital insights into past landscape development, land use and climate, the kettle hole revealed a fascinating and rare example of how such features were being utilised and manipulated by humans. The presence of well-preserved in situ archaeological remains dating from the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age, including organic remains such as wood and bone, have provided a rare insight into these periods and produced information for filling in certain gaps in the Mesolithic record in particular.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Excavation of a new rill pond was carried out by Pre-Construct Archaeology on 4th and 5th May 2021.    The rill pond is located on a raised scarp which extends along the north-eastern boundary of The Abbey's present curtilage.  Prior to the excavation the origin and date of this earthwork were unknown.  Adjacent to this scarp, within The Abbey grounds, are a series of raised platforms and other rectilinear earthworks which relate either to the medieval Benedictine nunnery which existed on the site, or a farm complex established following the Dissolution of the monastery in 1536.      The excavation found a single Middle to Late Iron Age pit, a post-medieval cattle burial, an undated posthole and a natural tree hollow.  A little residual flint-tempered pottery and struck flint also indicates the presence of earlier prehistoric (Mesolithic-Early Neolithic) activity in the local landscape.      There was no evidence for the ground having been deliberately built up at any time in the past.  Rather, the subsoil and topsoil had the appearance of a natural soil build-up.  This suggests that this raised area of the property was originally outside The Abbey curtilage, perhaps only being enclosed from the field to the east sometime in the 19th century.  The pronounced drop (c. 1m) in ground level from the scarp into the kitchen garden area to the west may therefore reflect the original limit of the monastic precinct on this side, where the ground was levelled for construction of the priory buildings.           </value>

During this time, an impressive prehistoric monument complex was uncovered, comprising three Neolithic cursuses and a complete Late Neolithic hengiform. This ceremonial activity is bracketed by earlier in situ Upper Palaeolithic and Late Mesolithic flint scatters found in association with preserved buried soil horizons, and later Bronze Age occupation, consisting of coaxial field system ditches, a partial ring gully, burnt stone pits and isolated cremation deposits. Two Roman trackways and several probable Roman quarry pits and ditches were also revealed. Beneath the alluvial overburden, substantial networks of braided palaeochannel systems had carved the gravel terraces into 'islands', across which the prehistoric activity was located. The Roman features were cut from within the alluvial overburden, whilst post-Medieval trackways were recorded in the uppermost alluvial and topsoil layers.  </value>

Archaeological evaluation demonstrated human activity of late prehistoric to modern date. Subsequent excavation examined two areas of 4.00m x 13.00m and 5.00m x 7.00m.  The earliest evidence of human activity comprised c.300 worked flints, including axe-sharpening debris and typologically dated as Mesolithic-Early Neolithic. Soil micromorphology identified a relic soil containing most lithics as overlain by up cast material, this up cast tentatively dated as Middle to Late Anglo-Saxon.   The evaluation recorded 10th and 11th-century activity in the north-west of the site on slightly rising ground near the posited location of St Vedast, thought a pre-conquest church. The evaluation also identified a probable north-south road of 12th-14th-century date in the north-west of the site.   Ceramic dating suggests the site flourished in the 14th-16th centuries, its location on low-lying land close to the River Wensum significant for the activities taking place. The presence of two nearby medieval friaries might have influenced this activity.    Evidence of medieval industries thought to be associated with leather, parchment production or perhaps horn working are suggested by a nationally important collection of goat-horn cores from the site. Isotope analysis of goat phalanges suggests sampled animals were raised in north-west Europe, perhaps locally.    Widespread medieval activity was characterised by pits with goat horn cores in areas with chalk or clay floors. The recovery of probable medieval pottery kiln debris suggests other industries at the site.     Activity declines from the 16th century, and deep post-medieval soils sealed earlier remains.   After this little seems to have occurred at the site until the 19th and 20th centuries, when a fish market and a Boulton and Paul ironmongery factory were established.  </value>

The earliest archaeological deposits were fluvial deposits that probably formed in the prehistoric period. Mesolithic and Bronze Age flints were retrieved from the prehistoric ground horizon.  In the Roman period the site was located on low-lying ground on the southeast margin of the north island. Throughout the Roman period numerous ditches were testament to an extensive and persistent effort, to drain and reclaim land that was often susceptible to flooding. A principal feature was a putative water channel probably not Guy's Channel but a parallel rivulet, conjectured to lie along the east side of the site. In the post-Roman era the site seems to have been reverted to undeveloped and little utilised marginal low-lying land. Only in the late 13th century were attempts made again to drain and reclaim the land. The water-channel on the east side of the site was re-cut and the bank revetted with timber. In the about the 15th century the water-channel had silted up the ground was consolidated and at least one major stone building erected.  Fragmentary masonry remains, patches of brick and stone surfaces and soakaway and culvert features recorded on the site were consistent with the building development of the 17th century.  In the 1720's the east side of the site was developed as part of Guy's Hospital. Part of the extended east wing of Guy's Hospital was identified and part of a surviving cellar floor recorded. A boundary wall separating the court of Guy's hospital and an adjacent court to the west was exposed. Masonry remains on the west side of the courtyard to Boland House may represent early 18th buildings or the extended west wing of Guy's Hospital built in the late 18th century.

This deposit included 118g of cremated bone, along with three stuck flints. This was complemented by the discovery of further Mesolithic flints across the site.  Three Early Neolithic pits were excavated, along with several Middle Neolithic pits. A single pit also contained Beaker pottery and flint.

Peat formation took place during the middle and late Bronze Age, prior to the accumulation of the Upper Alluvium.  During the accumulation of the Lower Alluvium the floodplain environment was dominated by sedges, grasses, aquatics and ferns with limited stands of floodplain woodland, whilst pine and hazel woodland appear to have occupied the dryland. Throughout the period of Peat formation, the floodplain surface was occupied by alder woodland; mixed deciduous woodland occupied the dryland, but declined mid-way through, most likely as a consequence of clearance.

The work produced a small assemblage of unstratified/residual Mesolithic to early Neolithic flintwork. Very dense scatters of flintwork have been reported in the fields to the east and the current work suggests some limited exploitation of the site itself during this period. A single pit appeared to represent a special deposit dating to the latest Bronze Age/earliest Iron Age. This included one pottery vessel apparently deposited largely intact and another in a fragmented but partially-complete state. Given the absence of other settlement evidence, it is suggested that this may have been deposited in an isolated location chosen for its association with a nearby brook. Finally, a narrow medieval ditch was recorded crossing the site on an east-north-east west-south-west orientation.

The evaluation recorded 10th and 11th-century activity in the north-west of the site on slightly rising ground near the posited location of St Vedast, thought a pre-conquest church. The evaluation also identified a probable north-south road of 12th-14th-century date in the north-west of the site.   Ceramic dating suggests the site flourished in the 14th-16th centuries, its location on low-lying land close to the River Wensum significant for the activities taking place. The presence of two nearby medieval friaries might have influenced this activity.    Evidence of medieval industries thought to be associated with leather, parchment production or perhaps horn working are suggested by a nationally important collection of goat-horn cores from the site. Isotope analysis of goat phalanges suggests sampled animals were raised in north-west Europe, perhaps locally.    Widespread medieval activity was characterised by pits with goat horn cores in areas with chalk or clay floors. The recovery of probable medieval pottery kiln debris suggests other industries at the site.     Activity declines from the 16th century, and deep post-medieval soils sealed earlier remains.   After this little seems to have occurred at the site until the 19th and 20th centuries, when a fish market and a Boulton and Paul ironmongery factory were established.  </value>

A disturbed animal burial was discovered at the southern end of Trench F and a land drain in the eastern end of Trench E. A small number of artefacts were recovered from the excavations consisting of two sherds of pottery, one of which may be Saxon, the struck flints and a large piece of metal, most likely agricultural in origin. </value>

The subsequent excavation, totalling 0.926ha, revealed residual Mesolithic to Neolithic finds, the remains of a possible structure of Late Bronze Age date, a Middle Iron Age enclosure with three probable roundhouses and associated sub-enclosures, pits and gullies, a probable medieval strip field system and post-medieval field boundary ditches.   The main sub-rectangular enclosure (XXsq m) and its associated structures, together with large quantities of pottery, moderate amounts of animal bone and limited charred plant remains, are indicative of a Middle Iron Age farmstead and associated agricultural land use.  Given the lack of Roman activity at the site and the stratigraphy of the features, the strip field system is most likely medieval in date. It indicates the agricultural nature of land use of the area during this period. In addition, two large deposits containing large domestic assemblages of medieval pottery were encountered in the north-east of the site.  Post-medieval and modern features were encountered across the site, including two east/west aligned post-medieval ditches comprising the remains of field boundaries depicted on the 1849 tithe map and later OS maps.</value>

The purpose of the walkover survey was to examine priority planting areas for several new conifer plantations along Geldie Burn and the upper reaches of the River Dee in the west of the estate, scheduled to commence in 2016 and 2017.   The survey did not reveal any visible indications of unrecorded archaeological finds or features, despite heavy levels of erosion sustained along the main watercourses adjacent to the planting areas. However, a large unrecorded enclosure which may have served as a sheep fold was discovered along the confluence of Geldie Burn and the River Dee. Additionally, eight prehistoric flints in the form of blades and debitage were recorded and collected from the footpath leading to the Chest of Dee, one of two currently known Mesolithic sites within the estate (Canmore ID 267763, NGR NO 0170 8855).   </value>

The upper fills of the enclosure ditches contained Late Bronze Age/ Early Iron Age settlement debris, but this is likely to derive from a secondary phase of settlement, the ditches having been open and filling-in for some time before this was deposited.  A Middle Bronze Age date is suggested for the enclosure's original construction, based partly on morphological parallels with a similar enclosure at Ormesby St Michael.  A curvilinear ditch inside the enclosure had the appearance of a roundhouse eaves-drip gully, probably associated with the phase of Late Bronze Age/ Early Iron Age occupation.  Other undated, but possibly prehistoric, ditches were identified nearby.      On the sloping ground in the central and eastern part of the site was an area of dispersed later prehistoric features including field boundary ditches, a water-hole, and a pit containing part of a Late Bronze Age/ Iron Age pottery vessel.  This area can be characterised as the agricultural 'infield' of the settlement.  Concentrations of Mesolithic and Neolithic struck flint, and some Early Bronze Age pottery, were found residually in features in Trench 12 and indicate a focus of earlier prehistoric activity on the lower ground in the east of the site.

<value columnNumber="1">This report is intended to inform the reader of the results of the excavation at 2 Little Smith Street: The excavations at 2 Little Smith Street were undertaken in accordance with the method statement produced by the Museum of London Archaeology (see Aitken 2009). Late Pleistocene sands potentially associated with the southern lower lying edge of Thorney Island have been identified; the surface of the sands is approximately at 0 m OD. The sediments were OSL dated to 15,000 yrs ago (&amp;#177;1000 years), placing them in the Late Pleistocene much earlier than the Early Holocene date previously given them (Sidell et al 2000). Therefore, there exist potential for human occupation on this dry land surface from the Late Pleistocene to Early Mesolithic and onwards, which should be considered in any future work on local sites. Thorney Island is a significant feature in London's archaeological record for our understanding of how the River Thames and its confluences influence past events, such the foundation of Westminster Abbey.  The excavations were also located to the south of the precinct of Westminster Abbey. Despite the site's proximity to such a significant historic site, cartographic evidence indicates the site was not built upon until the early-mid 17th century. Evidence of these early buildings were found in the form of walls, a pit, possibly two inglenook fireplaces and a brick-lined cess pit. Within the cess pit, a dump of clearance debris was excavated. Significant within this debris were pottery and glass assemblages associated with the Low Countries, suggesting the occupant of the associated property might have been a wealth Flemish merchant or similar professional.</value>

The results of the excavations showed that the landscape in Maidenhall immediately to the  west of the River Orwell in Ipswich had likely settlement on site during the Mesolithic,  Neolithic and Iron Age and was again settled in the 9th century as the Saxon town  expanded further south. This continued through the medieval, when occupation was at its  peak until the Black Death swept through the town during the 14th century.  </value>

The excavations consisted of two separate areas, totalling 0.84ha ha  and uncovered remains mainly of Middle to Late Bronze Age and medieval date.    The excavation found gullies and pits of a broad Late Prehistoric date. Scattered prehistoric superficial/residual finds also proved the occasional occupation of the site from the Upper Palaeolithic to the Early Bronze Age by peripatetic groups. The flint technology suggests that this occupation was more intense in the Mesolithic/Early Neolithic periods. A rectilinear field system extending across both excavated areas, circa 400m, was constructed in the Middle to Late Bronze. This appeared continuously modified and the purpose of which is likely to be for mixed pastoral and arable farming. However, the retrieved evidence pointed out to the prevalence of stock breeding. The segmented ditches and later modifications likely formed pens for livestock. The evidence for Late Iron Age/Roman occupation was scarce and focused in a small group of pits/postholes in Area 4.    In the Medieval period, both areas appeared exploited, and two field systems were constructed in each area. These appeared also modified in time and the enclosure -like field system in the east of Area 2b substituted by a field system of parallel ditches in the Late Medieval period. Associated with both fields were uncovered a number of pits which extended through the two phases of the Middle Age. Remains of Post-Medieval field boundaries along with pits and a large quarry were recorded in Area 4 whilst in area 2b it was uncovered an enclosure which contained a number of postholes in the west and north-west sides.  </value>

No evidence of in situ occupation was identified for any period. Finds were retrieved from the topsoil and upper horizon of colluvium to the west of the site. Nine pieces of Mesolithic and early Neolithic struck flint were retrieved from this re-deposited context. A single flint core is characteristic of the pyramidal cores carried by Mesolithic hunter gatherers. A small quantity of abraded pottery from the 12th-14th centuries and the 17th-18th centuries is indicative of manuring of the agricultural soil during these periods.

The evaluation comprised the  excavation of five evaluation trenches to a depth of between 1.5m  and 2m below the present ground surface (bpgs).  Geoarchaeological interest in the site derives from its location  within the Lea Valley, within an area which is on the interface  between the River Lea inner and its wider floodplains.  Archaeological interest is derived from the discovery within the site  of 120 pieces of struck flint recovered from an alluvial deposit,  some of which are attributable to the Mesolithic period, as well as  the discovery of an early medieval pile dwelling or crannog located  to the immediate east of the site.Pleistocene river terrace gravels  were recorded at between 1.4m and 2m bpgs, at the base of the  exposed sequence across the site. These were overlain in the  north of the site by brickearth deposits. Comparable deposits had  previously been recorded during trial pit evaluation of the site,  which represented Devensian period brickearth deposits of Enfield  silts, dating from c. 17,000 BP. Significant fine-grained  alluvial/fluvial deposits were also recorded across the site overlying  both the river terrace gravels and, where present, the brickearth.  The top of this alluvium was encountered at an average depth of  1.17m bpgs. These fine grained alluvial deposits represent Late  Pleistocene/Early Holocene development of the Lea Valley flood  plain. Cutting the top of the alluvium within Trench 3 was an  undated, east/west orientated feature, most likely representing a  natural erosion gully.

To investigate the wetland at the eastern side of the site which will be removed during excavation it is suggested that a trench be excavated across the area of impact. The impact of the piling on the wetland could be evaluated by four purposive geoarchaeological boreholes.

The aim of the work was to define the location, date, extent, character, condition, and quality of any archaeological remains on the site, to assess the significance of any such remains in a local, regional, or national context, as appropriate, and to assess the potential impact of the development proposals on the site's archaeology.    The trial trenching revealed traces of the prehistoric activity in the form of worked flint, recovered from unstratified soil horizons as well as later features, manufactured using various knapping technologies, and spanning the course of the Mesolithic to the Iron Age periods. The activity on site during the Middle-Late Iron Age period was also revealed by a hand-made pottery sherd, discovered in a large pit, in the eastern part of the site.    The most significant finding was the discovery of a potential pond or a quarry pit, a well and two kiln/oven-like structures, with an abundant level of finds and building material, dated to the Middle-Late Roman period, indicating the presence of high-status building/s in the vicinity of the area. Another important discovery was a series of ditches, pits, and postholes, also dated to the Roman period, identified across a large portion of the site (11 trenches).

The boreholes on site recorded the floodplain gravels between -1.1m OD and -2.06m OD as they sloped toward the river. As a whole the Holocene alluvial sequence is generally recorded from c. 0.7m OD (c. 5m bgl) to the west of the site and recorded from -0.06m OD (6.4m bgl) to the east. It is c. 2m thick across the site as a whole. Historic to post Medieval foreshore to foreshore dumping deposits containing sporadic clay pipe, glass and china finds were encountered between 1.92m OD and 5.2m OD. It is possible that remains of the late 18th to mid 19th Century buildings known to be located on the site may survive within these deposits. The thickness of modern made ground varies across the site and is recorded between 0.5 and 4.45m.    Within the alluvial sequence deep organic clays were indentified below c. -1.5m OD and could be of an early Mesolithic date. These deep organic deposits are overlain by over 2m of silty clay to peat deposits which appear to exist across the whole site below c. 0.75m OD. Trackways or jettys running from the foreshore zone may be preserved in these deposits.    Only the three boreholes reached sufficient depth to record alluvial deposits the resolution and spread of these were not sufficient to map the former route of the Tyburn on or around the site but further work may make this possible. The thick deposits of potentially Bronze Age and deeper Mesolithic organic deposits have a great potential to preserve palaeoenvironmental material such as pollen, diatoms, ostracods, plant macrofossils and insects. The potential of the peat and organic deposits for reconstructing the marked vegetation change they represent and potential for indirect evidence of human exploitation is good.       </value>

These revealed natural gravels beneath a sedimentary sequence representing the silting up of a deep palaeochannel around the Horsleydown Eyot.  The lower deposits indicated a fast-flowing channel and probably date to the early to mid-Holocene (Mesolithic). The upper deposits represent far quieter late prehistoric/historic backwater deposits which slowly infilled the channel to a point where reed-like or grassy vegetation was established and the area stabilised.  By the medieval period this area was probably a water meadow (i.e. seasonally wet, with water management systems such as drainage ditches in place). This was overlain by a series of dumped deposits which contained a fragment of roof tile dated to 1200-1480 and sherds of pottery dated 1580-1900.

The area is one of national importance for the study of the Final Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic occupation of Britain. The project was designed to assess the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental potential of the location and to mitigate the impact of the development on any significant deposits.    All phases of work revealed a series of fine grained alluvial deposits that overlay beds of gravel and peaty clay. These deposits apparently accumulated at the edge of an active river channel. The upper parts of the alluvium, which were over 1m thick, sealed a wooden stake, which had been sharpened using metal tools. Analysis of the earlier basal gravels and peaty clay deposits, through which a stake had been driven, were also alluvial sediment (deposited under slow moving fluvial or overbank conditions) and showed no hint of peat development.      The upper sedimentary sequence comprised sizeable alluvial deposits with no discernible boundaries. Given their stratigraphic position, seemingly over the metal cut wood, these are highly unlikely to be of early prehistoric date. Nevertheless the results were more directly relevant to the history of the Kennet and Avon Canal. It is probable that the sedimentary and archaeological results attest to changes in the hydrology of the River Kennet and can be attributed to the construction of the Kennet Navigation in the 18th century.    No further analysis is required to fulfil the project brief.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Cornwall Archaeological Unit was commissioned by the National Trust to undertake a programme of archaeological recording and investigation during groundworks for a sewer scheme involving new treatment plant and drainage pipes at Trerice House (Centred at SW 84064 58446) St Newlyn East. The scheme involved the excavation of pits for tanks as part of the sewage processing works, and pipework running close to the gardens of Trerice House which is a Listed Building, Grade I, and close to the manor barn, a Grade II Listed Building. The area was the site of an early medieval settlement, and a large medieval house is recorded here in the 14th to 15th centuries. The existing house and barn are of 16th century date.    Four flints were recovered from the waste water pipe trench. All are prehistoric, and the flint core and blade are potentially of Mesolithic date (8000-4000 BC). This is the first time that evidence for prehistoric activity has been recorded at Trerice.     A stone lined culvert was recorded adjacent to Trerice Cottage. No direct dating evidence for this feature was found, it is however, on a slightly different alignment to the buildings of the southern wing of the barn complex (late 16th or early 17th century) so may pre-date them. It is known that a complex of leats and tunnels associated with water management were constructed under the house and barn in the 16th century, and it is possible that the recorded culvert may be part of that system.    Apart from modern services, no archaeological features were found within the area of the sewage processing plant or the barn courtyard and no other features of archaeological interest or artefacts were recorded from the remainder of the site. It can therefore be concluded that the work had very little impact on any buried archaeological remains. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The invasive archaeological investigations undertaken by Headland Archaeology (UK) Ltd in advance of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route/Balmedie-Tipperty (AWPR/B-T) (Southern Leg) consisted of trial trench evaluation of the route, fourteen sample excavations of post-medieval sites and palaeoenvironmental coring at Hare Moss Wetland.    A total of 788 trenches were excavated across the route resulting in a total area investigated of 40,468 sq m. Ninety-eight archaeological features were identified, mostly discrete pits occurring in sparse distributions. Seven areas of archaeological potential were identified. These comprised a concentration of Mesolithic and other possible prehistoric features on either side of the River Dee, a Bronze Age/Iron Age roundhouse and associated features, a possible prehistoric ditch, and several scatters of probable prehistoric pits.    The sample excavations revealed information about the construction, extent and survival of features from the post-medieval period through to the recent past.    It would appear that activity is largely restricted to a few specific areas with particularly attractive outlooks or with access to certain resources (eg rivers). The majority of the route has only been brought into cultivation and taken advantage of in the relatively recent past.  </value>

These appeared to be spread across the site and comprised mainly of ditches as well as number of postholes and pits. Unfortunately, the majority of the features produced no finds and these therefore remain undated. Only four trenches produced dating material. Given their stratigraphic location beneath subsoil and the fact that they do not largely correlate to features shown on maps dating from the mid- 19th century it is likely that many of these undated features are in fact of some antiquity and could be prehistoric, Roman, medieval or early post-medieval; or a combination of these.    The earliest dating from the evaluation came from ditches found within Trenches 15, 21 and 43 which produced a small assemblage of struck flint dating to the Mesolithic or Neolithic period and provides further evidence to back up the presence of Mesolithic or Neolithic activity found within Geoarchaeological Test Pit 2, in Trench 27. The geoarchaeological test pits provided little evidence for alluvial sediments extending far from Copthorne Brook itself, and to the north of the stream no deposits of any geoarchaeological potential were encountered. To the south of the stream, however, there was evidence of a buried land surface with Mesolithic or early Neolithic lithic artefacts possibly recovered from a primary context. This artefact bearing horizon may extend further across the site to the east and west; the previous hand-excavated test pits being too shallow to encounter it, and it may relate directly to Mesolithic material recovered by McKerrow.      </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation was undertaken in February and March 2018 at land adjacent to  Hanborough Station, Long Hanborough, Oxfordshire (NGR SP 443180 214180). It was  commissioned by Orion Heritage Ltd on behalf of their client, Bloor Homes Western, in advance of  a consented residential development.  The excavation centred on a small spread of burnt stones and charcoal that was interpreted as  being part of a possible prehistoric burnt mound, which had been discovered during initial  archaeological evaluation of the site. It revealed more of a burnt stone and charcoal soil layer  alongside a series of cut features - pits and post/stakeholes - in the immediate surrounds, which  were considered to be associated with this layer. The group of features is typical of those often  encountered at a prehistoric burnt mound. As is common, the limited finds and environmental  assemblage did not elucidate or validate any of the hypotheses for the use of such sites.  Of particular interest in this instance, however, a programme of scientific dating produced early  Neolithic to early Bronze Age dates which suggested an unusually early and/or long-lived site  perhaps not directly comparable to the conventional middle to late Bronze Age examples of burnt  mounds. Flint pieces indicative of a Mesolithic or early Neolithic date and the environmental  remains (which included lime wood charcoal) also lent support to the dating of the features.  Overall, the dating and character of the remains would appear to be part of a long-lived burnt  mound that has origins in the earlier Neolithic, potentially being amongst the earliest examples  from England as a whole. It is clearly at the earlier end of the date range for those identified in the  Thames Valley (at places such as Yarnton) and across the midlands. In this regard, this site is a  significant component of the prehistoric character of the region.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The majority of structures were 20th-century in date as demonstrated by the use of cement as the bonding agent. However, some structural elements may be older. It is probable that stone sett surface 1805 recorded in Trench 18 was of 19th-century date. Surface 1805 appeared to stratigraphically precede the other recorded structures. Surface 1805 may have represented a trackway or other linear feature and ran approximately parallel to the Soar. Another candidate for a 19th-century date was firebrick surface 303, although this surface could be 20th century in date. The firebricks did not appear to have had a refractory function and had probably been used or re-used opportunistically   Any 19th-century remains would have probably been associated with the 'Bow Bridge Works (Elastic Fabrics  and c)' shown on the 1887 Ordnance Survey map as well as earlier maps dating back to at least 1828. Preservation of these remains across the site as a whole appears to be poor but not non-existent. The 20th-century structures are probably part of the depot shown on 20th-century maps.  It is possible that a black waterlogged layer (709) recorded at a depth of 3.3 m BGL may represent a peat layer buried beneath subsequent natural alluvial layers. The desk-based assessment for this site (Wessex Archaeology 2018) mentions that a Mesolithic peat layer has previously been recorded a short distance to the east during excavations at the Austin Priors site. Layer 709 was not sampled and could not be accessed due to the depth of the intervention.  </value>

The excavations consisted of two separate areas, totalling 0.84ha ha  and uncovered remains mainly of Middle to Late Bronze Age and medieval date.    The excavation found gullies and pits of a broad Late Prehistoric date. Scattered prehistoric superficial/residual finds also proved the occasional occupation of the site from the Upper Palaeolithic to the Early Bronze Age by peripatetic groups. The flint technology suggests that this occupation was more intense in the Mesolithic/Early Neolithic periods. A rectilinear field system extending across both excavated areas, circa 400m, was constructed in the Middle to Late Bronze. This appeared continuously modified and the purpose of which is likely to be for mixed pastoral and arable farming. However, the retrieved evidence pointed out to the prevalence of stock breeding. The segmented ditches and later modifications likely formed pens for livestock. The evidence for Late Iron Age/Roman occupation was scarce and focused in a small group of pits/postholes in Area 4.    In the Medieval period, both areas appeared exploited, and two field systems were constructed in each area. These appeared also modified in time and the enclosure -like field system in the east of Area 2b substituted by a field system of parallel ditches in the Late Medieval period. Associated with both fields were uncovered a number of pits which extended through the two phases of the Middle Age. Remains of Post-Medieval field boundaries along with pits and a large quarry were recorded in Area 4 whilst in area 2b it was uncovered an enclosure which contained a number of postholes in the west and north-west sides.  </value>

The work was conducted in part fulfilment of an archaeological Planning Condition, relating to the permitted 'Bar Pasture Extension' to Pode Hole sand and gravel quarry. The following interim report summarises the findings of three seasons of archaeological investigations at the quarry, conducted across extraction phases 6-8a.  These phases covered an area of c. 11 hectares of former arable land.  In accordance with an approved scheme of archaeological works (Richmond 2006), the investigations comprised a programme of strip, map and sample where a Bronze Age landscape was known to exist. The results compliment the Phase 1 and Phase 2-5 investigations which have previously been reported on (Richmond et. al. 2010; 2013). Completion of the archaeological works across Phases 6-8a has provided evidence of human activity on this part of the Site dating from the Mesolithic period through to the Early La T&amp;#232;ne Iron Age.  Activity was transient during the Mesolithic; the first sedentary activity occurred by the Late Neolithic or earliest Bronze Age and is evidenced by pit scatters containing worked flints and Beaker pottery. It was during the Early Bronze Age that the division and segregation of the Bar Pasture landscape appears to have been conceived. By the Middle Bronze Age, this had developed into a complex rectilinear field system with axial droveways that extended across the entire area. A series of pits, primarily waterholes and quarries, were found in association, as well as a number of temporary hearths</value>

The earliest feature identified comprised a ditch containing Bronze Age pottery and  Mesolithic or early Neolithic flint. This corresponded to an anomaly  on the geophysical survey and likely represents the remains of a barrow. A further  anomaly identified by the geophysical survey potentially  relates to this phase with a further probable circular barrow directly to the south of the  site.  The ceramic assemblage indicates that activity began in the Early Iron Age. Two roundhouses represent the main foci of activity in the southern/central part of the site.

Site SL/004B contained the remains of a single ring-ditch roundhouse which has been dated to the Middle Bronze Age. Further evidence of prehistoric settlement was found to the north at Site SL00/4D. This site contained the remains of six roundhouses ranging in date from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age.     .   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The 1.17ha site is occupied by later 19th and early 20th century listed standing buildings along with other associated buildings, which are shown on historic mapping. Earlier maps indicate the site was agricultural in use, with the nearby railway line and associated works intruding into the site area. The eastern part of the site, now unoccupied, was more recently utilised as a car salvage area.    The evaluation revealed the presence of buried archaeological remains in three of the eight trenches investigated. The recorded remains survived below a variable thickness of c.0.38-0.85m of overburden formed of made ground deposits. All of the trenches showed evidence of modern disturbance cut into the natural and below overburden deposits.    A single flint flake was found representing the Mesolithic or Early Neolithic period. This was found within a pit, though may be residual. Other pits and gullies were located in the area and were all undated. There were no other remains pre-dating the post-medieval period.    Post-medieval remains were found in the form of masonry. These remains likely form the western boundary of a structure visible in historic mapping, of which the eastern side is in situ in the form of corrugated iron sheds. Brick rubble to the west of this structure, could represent the remains of this structure.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Further to 2014 trial trench evaluation on this site, and following borehole monitoring undertaken by Southampton archaeological unit in 2014, further geoarchaeological investigation was undertaken by Wessex Archaeology in  2016 comprising borehole monitoring and deposit modelling.This confirmed the extent of natural Brickearth in the north-west corner of the Site, where Anglo-Saxon and pre-modern activity was focussed, and provided further information on the mill pond deposits. Models produced of the surface of the Tidal Flat deposits (TFD) and the underlying River Terrace deposits (RTD) indicate the general area of the former shoreline prior to reclamation of the foreshore to form the present day river edge / quayside, which lies approximately 150m to the east.    Examination of the deposit records also showed the location of one or more layers of peat, noted in 2014, extending along approximately 125m of the north-east boundary of the site, adjacent to the River Itchen. This peat was recorded at depths of between -2.5m OD and -8m OD, and is thought most likely to have formed in the earlier part of the prehistoric period. A Mesolithic to Neolithic date range can be provisionally suggested, though the sequence currently remains undated.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This is the first part of a three phase project which aims to reassess the Mesolithic archaeology of north east Yorkshire, within an area focussed on the upland landscape of the North York Moors and the adjacent Tees valley lowlands. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the nature of Mesolithic occupation in this area and it is anticipated that the project will result in a better and more complete understanding which will also contribute to the changing picture of the Mesolithic nationally.     The objectives of Phase 1 were to:   - collate previously unpublished or unrecorded material, including palaeoenvironmental evidence and privately held lithic assemblages   - compile a database of the Mesolithic resource for the project area  - assess existing lithic collections, both in museums and in private hands  - assess the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental resource and identify potential for further investigation.    Results  1. Numbers of recorded sites have increased and in particular more sites are now recorded from lower lying and peripheral areas.  2. A significant number of the known lithic assemblages are poorly documented and curated, and so have a limited value for further study.  3. Six types of location have been identified for Mesolithic sites in the project area, but targetted fieldwork is needed to clarify both the type of occupation found in different locations, the relationship between different types of location and the overall chronology.   </value>

Three areas of excavation were exposed (Areas A-C) totalling just over 0.8ha.   The excavation revealed a series of ditches broadly aligned north-east to south-west and north-west to south-east. These form components of a rectilinear Bronze Age field system incorporating a sub-square enclosure in Area C measuring c. 40m by 40m. The ditches and boundaries belong to a wider field system that extends across the Fengate area. A scatter of pits and postholes was also revealed.   A small assemblage of prehistoric finds was recovered from the excavations, dating from the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic to Early Iron Age periods. These include worked flint, pottery and animal bone, mostly deriving from pits and ditches associated with the field system. The pottery and animal bone are highly fragmented, and environmental remains were poorly preserved. Later finds were restricted to two sherds of Roman pottery and a post-medieval button. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The focus of the excavation was on two peri-glacial features identified during the evaluation stage which contained potentially significant flint assemblages. The excavation identified these two peri-glacial features, in addtion to one cut feature, an undated pit. PERI-GLACIAL FEATURE 1 was investigated and no finds were identified during the excavation.   On the other hand PERI-GLACIAL FEATURE 2 contained over 2000 pieces of struck flint recovered from five test pits and two sections. The majority of this flint dated from the Late Bronze Age and was deposited into the peri-glacial feature after it had partially silted up, but was likely still visible as a depression in the landscape. However there was evidence that flintworking had been undertaken over a considerable period of time in the vicinity of the peri-glacial feature, with evidence of Late Mesolithic-Early Neolithic blade technology and an Early Bronze Age arrow head.  Pottery identified within the PERI-GLACIAL FEATURE 2 ranged from the Middle Neolithic to the post-Medieval period, with a concentration of Late Bronze Age and Early Roman pottery, indicating that more focused activity was occurring in the immediate vicinity of the peri-glacial feature during these periods.  The majority of finds were located in the top of the peri-glacial feature, and heavy ploughing coupled with minimal overburden likely contributed to post-depositional mixing.   In order to recover as much flint as possible, 100% sieving of all contexts was undertaken on site.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The open area excavation was undertaken during October and November of 2018 and recovered evidence for early prehistoric activity at the site  represented by a small collection of five worked flints. These are likely to be the result of no more than intermittent or passing use of the site during the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age periods. Evidence of a more substantial presence on site during the later prehistoric period is represented by a thin scatter of pits of probable middle to late Iron date. The presence of residual pottery of Romano-British date within features of later date indicates activity of unknown character in the area during the period.  During the middle to late Saxon period a system of ditched enclosures or paddocks was established on the site. Despite excavation of many sections across the ditches which defined the enclosures, very little dating evidence was recovered, amounting to just 27 sherds of pottery of prehistoric, Roman, and  Saxon date. However, the absence of medieval material is significant and a radiocarbon date from a thin layer of charcoal in the base of one of the ditches suggests that the ditched landscape is of middle Saxon date.  Part of a possible post built structure may be associated with these land divisions. Firm evidence for Iron smithing on the site comes from the recovery of large quantities of hammerscale and smithing slag from an environmental sample taken from a pit located adjacent to one of the ditches. Analysis of the environmental samples indicates domestic occupation during the Anglo-Saxon period, probably located somewhere near the southern and western limits of the site. A series of north south aligned shallow furrows overlying the ditch systems indicates agricultural use of the site, probably during the medieval and post-medieval periods.      </value>

These were overlain by a sequence of Holocene deposits consistent with those recorded elsewhere around the Royal Docks and North Woolwich.  Potentially Mesolithic sands and silts from the meandering Thames floodplain were succeeded by the growth of 2.6m of peat deposits, including wooded bands indicating stabilisation within a floodplain backswamp environment. Layers of peaty mud were recorded, possibly indicating proximity to a tidal creek with regular overbank flooding while alluvial clays from an increasingly estuarine environment were recorded throughout the site, generally dating from the Iron Age to the present. Rootlets indicated that the water was periodically shallow enough to allow reed growth while fragmentary oxidised peat deposits at the surface of the clay probably indicate the first emergence of the area as tidal marsh and seasonal grazing in the later Middle Ages.</value>

The work, carried out on behalf of Aggregate Industries (UK) Ltd, formed the final stage of an approved programme of archaeological mitigation required to 'preserve by record' any archaeological features identified within the permitted quarry extension. The areas excavated encompassed quarry phases 3-8. During the 2012-2014 investigations at Tucklesholme, archaeological evidence was found for human activity on the site dating from the Upper Palaeolithic to the post-Medieval period.  No secure evidence of Mesolithic activity was found, but Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman, Saxon and Medieval archaeology was represented.    One of the most significant findings was an in-situ scatter of Late Upper Palaeolithic flints, which attests to tool-making and processing activities on part of the site during the Lateglacial, when it formed part of a braided river landscape created by the retreating ice. The flint assemblage provides crucial evidence regarding the extent of human occupation in central Britain during the first phase of re-colonisation after c. 10,300 years ago.    </value>

Since the 2012 SHERF document was completed there have been three major publications on the historic environment of Scilly, Katharine Sawyer's PhD thesis 'Isles of the Dead? The Setting and Function of the Bronze Age Chambered Cairns and Cists of the Isles of Scilly' (2015), 'The Lyonesse Project: A Study of the Evolution of the Historic Coastal and Marine Environment of the Isles of Scilly' (Charman et al 2016) and 'Neolithic Stepping Stones: Excavation and survey within the western seaways of Britain, 2008-2014' (Garrow and Sturt 2017), as well as numerous other archaeological interventions.    These three publications represent major advances in our understanding of Scilly during prehistory, particularly during the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Consequently, in June 2018, a project to update the Research Framework was commissioned by Historic England resulting in this revised document.    </value>

The report, commissioned by NPS Property Services, will form part of a submission for planning permission for the construction of a school and three residential blocks.    The proposed area of development is located at the western edge of a sub rectangular field to the east of West Acre Road and north of the historic core of Swaffham. The Site itself is a sub rectangular area occupying the southern part of the field and is bordered by the Acre Road to the west, a strip of woodland to the south, and modern warehouse and industrial installations to the east. It is open on the north side.    Metal detecting surveys carried out mostly on fields located to the west of the Site recovered finds dating from the Mesolithic to the post medieval periods, including Mesolithic and Neolithic axeheads and other prehistoric flints and pottery fragment. The distribution of known heritage assets within the 1km assessment area and cartographic evidence dating from the post medieval period suggests that the proposed area of development was located away from the foci of settlement during the Roman and post Roman periods comprising agricultural land from at least the medieval period onwards, or probably earlier, and likely saw low intensity activity, such as agriculture, during these periods.

These appeared to be spread across the site and comprised mainly of ditches as well as number of postholes and pits. Unfortunately, the majority of the features produced no finds and these therefore remain undated. Only four trenches produced dating material.    The earliest dating from the evaluation came from ditches found within Trenches 15, 21 and 43 which produced a small assemblage of struck flint dating to the Mesolithic or Neolithic period and provides further evidence to back up the presence of Mesolithic or Neolithic activity found within Geoarchaeological Test Pit 2, in Trench 27. The geoarchaeological test pits provided little evidence for alluvial sediments extending far from Copthorne Brook itself, and to the north of the stream no deposits of any geoarchaeological potential were encountered. To the south of the stream, however, there was evidence of a buried land surface with Mesolithic or early Neolithic lithic artefacts possibly recovered from a primary context. This artefact bearing horizon may extend further across the site to the east and west; the previous hand-excavated test pits being too shallow to encounter it, and it may relate directly to Mesolithic material recovered by McKerrow.    Trenches 40 and 43 produced a small amount of pottery which was dated to the Late Iron Age/Roman period. This would appear in keeping with the results from an evaluation of the Balcombe Road site revealing evidence for land division between the same period. Four sherds of 13th century medieval pottery were also recovered from a ditch in Trench 43 and a single fragment of glass recovered from an environmental sample from Trench 59 appears to be post-medieval.  </value>

Four substantial curvilinear palaeochannel features, with lower organic fills, were encountered across at the site. In one of the palaeochannels, a large concentration of wood was preserved in waterlogged conditions due to the presence of a ground water spring. Post-excavation assessment of the 1439 pieces of preserved wood has identified that the vast majority comprises roots and bark, with lesser amounts of branch wood and round wood logs. Four of the five pieces sampled for radiocarbon dating produced dates between 3619 cal BC and 2309 cal. BC; the fifth piece produced a date of cal. AD 343-535. The findings suggest this material is a natural wood-peat deposit, preserved in the waterlogged conditions of the palaeochannel. Only 22 pieces (1.71%) of the wood in this feature have definite or possible signs of working; the six definitely worked stakes and posts displayed metal axe signatures and were probably driven down from higher up and may date to the medieval period. Direct dating these pieces will resolve this question.  Finds in the lower portion of this palaeochannel comprise early Neolithic pottery and animal bone, including deer antlers with cut marks and areas of worn polish on the interior of the skull, suggesting their use as a headdress, evidence the utilisation - possibly for ritual purposes - of this ground water spring at this time. The find of an Aurochs skull, radiocarbon dated to 4449-4415 cal. BC, with a possible cut mark, further indicate the site's significance as spanning the Mesolithic to Neolithic transition.</value>

During the watching brief, visual inspection of recent unmonitored ground disturbance outwith the trial trenching area but within the development area identified prehistoric lithics. A series of test pits were excavated in order to ascertain the extent of the lithic spread. Initial cursory identification of these lithics suggest they could be Bronze Age/Neolithic in date, or potentially Mesolithic. It is recommended that further archaeological fieldwork be carried out to allow greater understanding of the site and further recovery of artefacts before the ground works commence for improvements to the road.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The test pitting took place on 2-4 November 2018. 37 test pits were excavated and 305 flints recovered by 27 adult and 6 children as well as two local primary school classes of 34 children, teachers and adult helpers.  37 test pits were excavated on what may be resolved by surveying as three river terraces in the field. Although no features were excavated the lithics from the TPs comprised mainly flakes and blades as well as a number of small flakes and spalls (from burning or frost damage). Just seven cores were found, from five TPs in the SE corner of the field. The cores are varied in form with three single platform blade cores, one opposed platform blade core, one with blade and flake removals from two platforms made at a right angle, and there are two core fragments.  The blade technology demonstrated on the cores is reflected in the types of blank produced with a high proportion of blades (41%) to flakes (59%) from the test pits.  Several retouched tools were also recovered. These were concentrated in the SE corner with five from TP1 including a narrow blade microlith, an oblique truncation, a knife form, and two edge retouched blades. A notched blade came from TP15. Most of these are likely to date to the Mesolithic but the knife form made on a broad blade and with blunting edge retouch down one side may date to the Neolithic.    </value>

Various concentrations of remains, indicative of archaeological sites of significance, were identified.  A small quantity of possibly Mesolithic flint debitage and a Neolithic axe or adze were retrieved from alluvium deposits in the north-west of the scheme area. Three small clusters of Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age ditches and pits were recorded. Four concentrations of Early Roman ditches, pits, postholes, a trackway and cremation burials were identified as possible occupation foci.  Two concentrations of medieval pits, ditches, gullies and structural postholes possibly constitute 12th/13th-century settlement alongside a historic lane. Remains of a post-medieval farmstead were found at the west end of the scheme area. other post-medieval ditch remains relate to former boundaries of the post-medieval and later field system.  A number of large probable quarry pits  infilled in the late 19th and 20th centuries were also recorded.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The majority of structures were 20th-century in date as demonstrated by the use of cement as the bonding agent. However, some structural elements may be older. It is probable that stone sett surface 1805 recorded in Trench 18 was of 19th-century date. Surface 1805 appeared to stratigraphically precede the other recorded structures. Surface 1805 may have represented a trackway or other linear feature and ran approximately parallel to the Soar. Another candidate for a 19th-century date was firebrick surface 303, although this surface could be 20th century in date. The firebricks did not appear to have had a refractory function and had probably been used or re-used opportunistically   Any 19th-century remains would have probably been associated with the 'Bow Bridge Works (Elastic Fabrics  and c)' shown on the 1887 Ordnance Survey map as well as earlier maps dating back to at least 1828. Preservation of these remains across the site as a whole appears to be poor but not non-existent. The 20th-century structures are probably part of the depot shown on 20th-century maps.  It is possible that a black waterlogged layer (709) recorded at a depth of 3.3 m BGL may represent a prehistoric peat layer buried beneath subsequent natural alluvial layers. The desk-based assessment for this site (Wessex Archaeology 2018) mentions that a Mesolithic peat layer has previously been recorded a short distance to the east during excavations at the Austin Priors site. Layer 709 was not sampled and could not be accessed due to the depth of the intervention.  </value>

The work comprised an initial test pit evaluation, comprising a total of 15 1m by 1m test pits, followed by archaeological monitoring of soil stripping and drainage excavations.   The underlying natural geology was recorded at a maximum elevation of 153.62m aOD towards the centre of the site, falling away to 151.96m aOD to the south-west, 150,87m aOD to thesouth-east, and a minimum height of 148.75 aOD to the north-east. A small assemblage of residual later prehistoric struck flint hints at some prehistoric activity in the general vicinity, broadly spanning the Late Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age, and a similarly limited residual assemblage of medieval pottery attests to some probable agricultural activity associated with the medieval manor of Knole. Evidence for Late Medieval/Early Post-Medieval activity was encountered in the south-west corner of the site, in the form of an extensive dump layer or midden, incorporating domestic refuse and demolition material dated to the period c. 1475-1575. This layer and the material contained therein is broadly contemporary with major phases of construction at Knole, associated either with Archbishop Bourchier or his successors and probably represents the disposal of demolition material generated by ongoing building work, along with domestic refuse.

The project was undertaken in advance of the  residential development of the site and was preceded by a geophysical survey, a desk-based  assessment, field walking and an archaeological trial trench evaluation. Based on known sites/ find  spots in the area and the results of earlier work the site was considered to have good archaeological  potential, particularly for remains of prehistoric and Saxo-Norman/ medieval date.  In the event, the excavation encountered an agricultural landscape dating between the Saxo-Norman  and post-medieval periods. The earlier part of this range included a small, semi-subterranean  structure and associated drying kiln. A second kiln was present within the High medieval to postmedieval  landscape, in addition to the site of a post mill. The economy throughout the medieval to  post-medieval period was based on a mixed farming regime, dominated by crop husbandry. At some  time during or after the High medieval period, the site's layout developed from a complex system of  ditched enclosures to a more open land-use.  The Saxo-Norman to post-medieval evidence was indirectly predated by scattered prehistoric finds of  struck flint - spanning the Mesolithic to Bronze Age - predominantly made up of residual material  from later features/ contexts.

This comprised the excavation of nine areas, totalling C8840m2. In addition, a further six evaluation trenches were opened.   Prehistoric activity was restricted to a cluster of pits and a ditch in Area 4 dated to the middle-late Iron Age on the basis of associated pottery. Environmental samples from these features produced a useful assemblage of charred plant remains and charcoal, especially as the region is noted for a lack of analysed later prehistoric archaeobotanical remains.  Earlier activity in the area was suggested by the discovery of an early Bronze Age barbed-and-tanged arrowhead and two late Mesolithic/early Neolithic bladelets found in an Iron Age pit. No further Bronze Age activity was discovered, despite the presence of an urned early or middle Bronze Age cremation deposit found during the evaluation. The earlier evaluation also discovered two early to middle Saxon pits. No further evidence of this date was uncovered during the present excavation.  A trackway and a number of linear ditches probably relating to field divisions were discovered.

Nineteen trenches were excavated across the site to reveal the underlying natural firm mottled light brown-orange/ light grey silt sand clay at a maximum elevation of 56.67m AOD in the east of the site area, falling away slightly to 54.32m AOD in the west of the site (Trench 9).    The investigation has succeeded in identifying archaeological features in 12 of the 19 trenches. A very small quantity of residual struck flint artefacts suggests that there was some activity of Mesolithic to Early Neolithic date in the vicinity. However, much of the archaeological activity recorded appears to be related to a settlement of Early Roman date with a possible eaves-drip gully associated with three postholes an associated field system, and a possibly contemporary land division.     Securely dated medieval activity was limited to a single pit and two intercutting ditches however; these features lay in close proximity to three other undated features which may be contemporary.

The fieldwork was commissioned by Clifford Dann in advance of the installation of industrial units, car park and associated groundworks.    The excavation revealed residual evidence of Mesolithic activity and subsequent Middle Neolithic flintwork and pottery within a tree bole. In addition to this, a concentration of Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age lithics was revealed, tentatively described as a flint scatter. Much of the stripped site was covered in a thin layer of colluvium which contained a mixed assemblage of lithics and pottery ranging from the Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, which masked a number of similarly dated tree boles. Several Neolithic to Bronze Age pits and a possible waterhole were also revealed on site.    Two Late Bronze Age pits were uncovered which yielded small assemblages of flint and pottery. Three Middle Iron Age pits were also observed cutting through the colluvium, which might relate to nearby excavations at Farrington Farm.     The relatively large assemblage of lithics recovered from the site, along with the possible flint scatter are of some local significance, providing further evidence of the use of the landscape during the Neolithic. The lithics from this site suggest a different pattern of flintworking to that observed at Brighton and Hove Wastewater Treatment Works and comparison of the two might provide greater insight into the use of the landscape during this time.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The latest phase of investigations has revealed evidence of Neolithic flint working  as well as a small cluster of shallow Bronze Age pits. In previous excavation phases, prehistoric features have included a 'ritual shaft' of Late Neolithic date containing Beaker pottery;  a contracted (or 'crouched') Bronze Age burial, and scatters of Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic worked flints. These discoveries indicate that the area may have been used to manufacture hunting equipment such as projectile points, demonstrating repeated and perhaps seasonal use of the landscape for hunting and retooling.   Previous investigations have also revealed extensive farming of Iron Age and Romano-British date including graves, enclosures, pits and building foundations. The new excavations have found  boundary ditches and enclosures continuing from adjacent excavation areas with the addition of a fence-lined trackway, possibly used to control the movement of animals from the out-lying fields towards enclosures. The pottery from previous excavations already forms a regionally significant group of 'Belgic' material and indicates that the settlement was of unusual status.   A single burial was found in the 2011 work, seemingly placed within a ditch of possible Iron Age or Roman date.  By the late Roman period occupation appears to have been located elsewhere, but still close by - it may lie beneath parts of the parkland to the north-west.   In the 5th century, Anglo-Saxon farmers are known to have been constructing their characteristic 'halls' and sunken-featured buildings (SFBs) in the corners of the former Iron Age and Roman fields. The 2011 excavations found two SFBs, one of which was particularly well-preserved SFB: it contained loom weights and other finds indicating textile working.   Features hinting at medieval settlement were recorded in the southern part of the excavation area. Of particular note is evidence for Late Saxon or early medieval jet-working which came from a pit fill. </value>

One pit or posthole was dated as Mid- Late Bronze Age. One ditch and one possible pit or ditch terminus was dated as being of Late Bronze Age date.  One ditch was dated as prehistoric from undiagnostic pottery sherds and one ditch was securely dated as of 1st to 2nd century Roman date.  One structure was dated as 18th to 20th century date. All other features remained undated. However, the vast majority of archaeological features were sealed by subsoil, other than five ditches encountered in Trenches 12, 35, 37 and 38, a possible ditch terminus in Trench 39, a pit in Trench 17, and a structure in Trench 24 which were all sealed by a topsoil deposit.  A single pit in Trench 26 was sealed by a deposit of colluvium.

<value columnNumber="1">Site 23 was originally designated as a Watching Brief but because of the scale and complexity of the features encountered the work was upgraded to a Set Piece Excavation. Four substantial curvilinear palaeochannel features, with lower organic fills, were encountered across at the site. In one of the palaeochannels, a large concentration of wood was preserved in waterlogged conditions due to the presence of a ground water spring. Post-excavation assessment of the 1439 pieces of preserved wood has identified that the vast majority comprises roots and bark, with lesser amounts of branch wood and round wood logs. Four of the five pieces sampled for radiocarbon dating produced dates between 3619 cal BC and 2309 cal. BC; the fifth piece produced a date of cal. AD 343-535. The findings suggest this material is a natural wood-peat deposit, preserved in the waterlogged conditions of the palaeochannel. Only 22 pieces (1.71%) of the wood in this feature have definite or possible signs of working; the six definitely worked stakes and posts displayed metal axe signatures and were probably driven down from higher up and may date to the medieval period. Direct dating these pieces will resolve this question.  Finds in the lower portion of this palaeochannel comprise early Neolithic pottery and animal bone, including deer antlers with cut marks and areas of worn polish on the interior of the skull, suggesting their use as a headdress, evidence the utilisation - possibly for ritual purposes - of this ground water spring at this time. The find of an Aurochs skull, radiocarbon dated to 4449-4415 cal. BC, with a possible cut mark, further indicate the site's significance as spanning the Mesolithic to Neolithic transition.</value>

This report details the results of a programme of borehole recording undertaken on land at Star Carr Farm, Seamer, North Yorkshire as a post-determination planning requirement (ref: 16/02543/DEC). The borehole work was undertaken to characterise the potential effects of the proposed development on the archaeological resource.  The evaluation has shown that layers of developed peat, which are primary indicators of the potential for surviving  archaeological remains were observed across the proposed area of development. Given the impact depths expected during the proposed development, it is anticipated that there will be a widespread impact upon the surviving layers of in situ peat across the site from drainage and foundation works.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A heritage impact assessment was commissioned by James Stockdale Ltd through their agent Gallagher Planning Ltd in order to assess the potential effects of a proposed agricultural development on the cultural heritage resource of the surrounding area.  The proposed development will comprise the construction of three potato storage buildings, an area of hardstanding, landscaping and associated works and infrastructure. Given the known presence of the Early Mesolithic artefact scatter within the proposed development site and its position on the shores of palaeo-Lake Flixton, as well as the nearby presence of the scheduled Mesolithic site of Star Carr, other related, well-preserved remains may survive within the development area. The probability of the site to host previously unknown archaeology of other periods is considered to be low.  It is considered that the proposed development will be only a very minor element of  any wider landscape views. It is therefore considered that the proposed development will have a negligible impact on the setting of the scheduled monument.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A Community Archaeology project was organised under the auspices of Archaeology South-East (ASE), a division of University College London Centre for Applied Archaeology (UCLCAA). The current report provides the results of the second season of archaeological investigation of a 3.7ha field called Little Stiances, located at Sharpsbridge Lane, Newick, East Sussex. This work was carried out in June 2013.    Geophysical and topographic surveys carried out in 2010 confirmed the location of a 'lost' cottage known from cartographic sources and allowed the targeting of test-pits at that location both in 2010 and during the second season of investigation in 2013. This year the 'Cottage Site' again produced a range of finds reflecting the occupation of buildings in that part of the field mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Finds ranged from pottery, glass and clay pipes to the bricks and tiles from demolished building(s), to more 'personal' artefacts such as the remains of a knife, a fork and a number of decorated buttons. Some of the character of the interior of the building(s) is shown by the survival of door fittings, and part of a decorative metal plate, probably from the cooking range. Peculiarly the excavation this year also yielded metalwork elements from a number of different sizes of shoe, and the remains of part of a leather boot, complete with brass eyelets.    Investigation of a smaller 'House Platform' adjacent to a sunken lane (both identified during the topographical survey in 2010) uncovered evidence of medieval activity represented by a small assemblage of 13th to 15th century pottery. Discovery of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork highlights the use of the general area by Hunter/Gatherers stretching the site's chronology back into prehistory.    </value>

The fieldwork was commissioned by CgMs Consulting.     The evaluation identified a series of prehistoric phases across the Site, encompassing evidence of limited Late Mesolithic/ Early Neolithic transient activity, and evidence of occupation of an undefined nature in the Middle/ Late Bronze Age and Middle/ Late Iron Age periods, with an apparent hiatus in the Early Iron Age.    Evidence for Late Iron Age/ early Roman settlement was identified across the Site, with the main focus of this settlement centered on the southwestern part of the Site, north and west of a Roman road, coterminous with the extant Chilmington Green Road. A possible section of Roman road was also recorded between Chilmington Green Road and a possible enclosure west of Netter's Farm, identified by a previous geophysical survey.     In addition, the evaluation identified field systems of medieval date, with evidence that these were maintained into the modern era. A possible late medieval enclosure, perhaps enclosing a farmstead, was also identified alongside the line of the former Roman road.  </value>

The results of the deposit modelling indicate that the sediments present beneath Plot 18.03 are similar in character to those recorded elsewhere on Greenwich Peninsula; the Late Devensian Shepperton Gravel is overlain by a sequence of Holocene alluvial sediments, buried beneath modern Made Ground. The site lies on the northeastern edge of a possible Late Devensian/Early Holocene palaeochannel; the resultant topography across the site is highly variable, and towards the northeast, where the Gravel surface lies above -1m OD, there is potential for the survival of archaeological remains. Where the Gravel surface is lower, up to 3.1m of Holocene alluvial deposits are recorded, and here up to 0.5m of peat was recorded in two boreholes. These organic sediments are thin, and only locally present; in addition, radiocarbon dating of the base of the peat in indicates that accumulation began here during the early Bronze Age, within the general age range of the peat recorded elsewhere on Greenwich Peninsula (late Mesolithic to late Bronze Age), and of similar age to environmental archaeological investigations that have already been undertaken elsewhere on Greenwich Peninsula. On this basis, no further environmental archaeological assessment is recommended on the samples from Plot 18.03. </value>

The fieldwork produced a mixed flint assemblage ranging in date from the Mesolithic to later prehistory, in keeping with previous finds from the site. The test pitting demonstrated that whilst the geophysical survey had identified some archaeological features, other anomalies were probably the product of underlying geology. Of the five test pits excavated in 2013, two identified cut features which are undated, whilst a third exposed the remains of a hearth containing Mesolithic or early Neolithic flint within and below it.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Geoarchaeological investigations were carried out at the Isis House site in order to: (1) clarify the nature of the sub-surface stratigraphy, and (2) clarify the nature, depth, extent and date of any alluvium and organic/peat deposits. Following the results of the initial deposit modelling exercise, it was recommended that a programme of radiocarbon dating was carried out in order to assess the age of the Peat horizon at the Isis House site in comparison to those already recorded in the area of the Bankside Channel, and to assess the need for subsequent environmental archaeological assessment of the sequence.    The results of the deposit modelling indicate that the Isis House site lies towards the main axis of the Bankside Channel: here, a Gravel surface as low as -5m OD is deeper than has been identified elsewhere within the channel. The sequence of Holocene sedimentation overlying the Gravel is similar to that recorded elsewhere within the Bankside Channel, incorporating a horizon of Sand, the silty/sandy Lower Alluvium, Peat, and the clay-rich Upper Alluvium, overlain by modern Made Ground. Here, the Peat is relatively thin, at between 0.4 and 0.6m thick, perhaps indicative of prolonged fluvial activity at this location either preventing the accumulation of peat, or subsequently eroding its surface. The results of the radiocarbon dating indicate that Peat accumulation occurred at the present site during the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic transition, lying within the age and elevation range of the organic deposits at Surrey House, immediately to the east (Batchelor et al., 2012), from where environmental archaeological analysis of a thick Peat sequence has already been carried out. Given the thin nature of the surviving Peat deposits at Isis House, and their contemporary age with the deposits at Surrey House, no further environmental archaeological assessment is therefore recommended. </value>

The last 170 years of railway use of this land have had a profound effect on the ground levels and nature of the upper 0.5m of this area and in some trenches this activity has extended to a depth of more than 1m; however, below this material a sequence of medieval to post-medieval agricultural activity appears to characterise the surviving archaeology. While the trench locations and lengths were compromised by the modern activity and the presence of extensive live services within the area, enough ground was covered to establish that the prehistoric activity recorded at the nearby prison site does not extend into this area. The presence of a sandy clay natural within all the trenches, rather than the anticipated limestone brash, may also suggest that the site lies within a historical wetland environment. Little dating evidence was retrieved, but pottery and clay tobacco pipe fragments from the features suggest post-medieval activity: a sherd of Roman-British pottery and two Mesolithic/Early Neolithic abraded flints recovered during the evaluation are indicative only of the presence of background activity within the area.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">Excavations carried out by Archaeology South-East on the site of the American Express (Amex) Community Stadium, Falmer, East Sussex have revealed exciting evidence of over 7000 years of human activity.  The earliest occupation found was a Mesolithic camp, centred on a clearing in the woods and where the production of flint tools (microliths) was carried out. The scale of this production is unprecedented in East Sussex. Much of the flintwork was found deposited in five groups of deep pits.  There was little recognisable human activity at the site in the Early and Middle Neolithic periods but geoarchaeological investigations have shown that the landscape continued to change with probable deforestation which caused colluvial deposition within the river valley to the west.     In the Late Neolithic / Early Bronze Age, a large ring ditch was dug, almost in the exact spot as the Mesolithic woodland clearing and mirroring its broadly circular shape.  Subsequently, two further ring ditches were dug on the same alignment as the first.  There are a number of possibilities for what these ring ditches may have been, ranging from circular buildings to henges to the most likely explanation, a barrow group. Whatever their function, the structures were re-visited later in prehistory; a testament to the continued topographic importance of the site.    Finally the site became the focus of Anglo-Saxon habitation including a sunken feature building, in order, perhaps, to shepherd flocks of animals over large distances, and representing a satellite site to the large areas of similarly dated occupation to the east and west.  </value>

Although all seven HERs had different starting points and are very diverse in terms of their format, scope and origins, each of the projects achieved significant and positive results within relatively limited timescales and budgets. The open-ended nature of the original call for proposals resulted in a range of different approaches to early prehistoric HER enhancement being developed and trialed, each of which has been tested and from which lessons have been learned. Each of the pilot projects can be deemed successful, and a number of common themes have emerged which will guide future best practice when undertaking HER enhancement of the early prehistoric and other periods. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Six trial trenches were excavated, revealing gravelly sand overlain by a layer of clays and sandy clays. In trenches on the W side of the site, this latter deposit had an orange iron-stained clay and gravel band at its surface, which probably represents higher areas that (at least sporadically) lay above the water. These areas may have provided prehistoric settlers with 'stepping stones' across the edge of the floodplain.  Overlying the clays was a layer of peat and organic clay, possibly representing a Mesolithic or Neolithic land surface. This area would have been attractive to human settlers early in the Holocene, as it provided habitable areas on the edge of the floodplain with access to the river as well as fresh water flowing from the valley side, and recent excavations at Belmarsh West (BWQ08) N of the portal site have uncovered significant Neolithic timber structures. Alluvial clay overlay the organic layer, and was probably laid down by estuarine waters encroaching on the edge of the floodplain.

The results indicate a sequence of Shepperton Gravel, overlain by Holocene alluvial sediments, buried beneath modern Made Ground. The surface of the Gravel slopes downwards from north-west to south/south-east across the site, largely resting between -4 and -6m OD. The site clearly lies close to the floodplain/dryland edge, with Gravel surfaces typical of the Taplow Gravel terrace towards the northwest. A similar sequence of deposits is recorded across the neighbouring Beam Park site to the east. The Shepperton Gravel (and occasional sand) is overlain by a tripartite sequence of Lower Alluvium, Peat and Upper Alluvium. The Peat generally ranges between 1.5 and 3m in thickness, reaching over 3.5m in five records. Peat accumulation began at the site during the Late Mesolithic continuing until the Late bronze Age, falling within the general period of peat formation in this area. The results of the assessment of the peat are indicative of a peat surface dominated by alder, with an understorey of sedges and occasional grasses and aquatics. Hazel, ash and birch may have occupied the peat surface with alder, but are more likely to grown on the dryland forming mixed deciduous woodland with oak and lime.</value>

The fieldwork was commissioned by Wincer Kievenaar Architects Ltd on behalf of their clients and carried out in advance of residential development.    A preceding geophysical survey of the c.5.6ha site detected a number of broad linear anomalies in the southern part of the site, most of which were interpreted as being of natural origin. A number of the trenches were targeted upon selected anomalies in order to validate the results of this survey.    Twenty-nine trenches were excavated across the site, of which five were identified to contain archaeological features. These remains, predominantly postholes and some pits were concentrated in the south and west of the site, in Trenches 16, 22, 23, 31 and 32. No correlation was exhibited to any of the targetted geophysical anomolies; the interpretation of the geophysical anomolies has been demonstrated to be accurate.    Two scrapers and fifteen unmodified pieces of flint d&amp;#233;bitage, including six flakes, two blades and three blade-like flakes, were recovered from pits in Trenches 22 and 23, all tentatively assigned a broad Mesolithic-Neolithic date, providing limited evidence of prehistoric activity within the site.     A high density of Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age features (1150-600BC) was confined to the south of the site at the base of the slope occupied by the site.  A concentration of twenty postholes in Trenches 31 and 32 exhibited no discrete clusters or alignments, but are thought to constitute one or more post-built building/s. The presence of a high frequency of burnt/overfired pottery fragments in the assemblage recovered from posthole [32/010] possibly constitutes pottery production waste and evidence for industrial activity in the vicinity but the function of building/s is not clear.  </value>

Trenches 21 and 45 from the archaeological Evaluation recorded a potential ditch, a series of pits and an assemblage of Mesolithic to Neolithic flints were recovered from the topsoil and hillwash deposits of trench 21. As such the archaeological Excavation sought to expand the area of investigation centred on these two trenches to fully investigate and record the archaeological resource.   The Excavation has shown that the southern extent of the Site is populated by a series of small to large isolated pits, the previously recorded potential ditch feature from Trench 21 of the Evaluation was revealed to be an elongated pit and therefore matched the other feature types in this area.   During the removal of the overburden deposits in Area 21 a large assemblage of worked flint has been collected, attesting to a high level of Mesolithic to Neolithic activity within the vicinity of the Site. Based on the topography of the Site and its immediate environs and given the retrieval of the flint from the upper stratigraphic deposits within Area 21 it is mostly likely redeposited from the brow of the hill to the northwest of Area 21, just beyond the boundary of the Site, and having washed downhill and settled in the natural shallow basins caused by undulations due to the variations in the natural drift geology below.   </value>

The  archaeological works comprised the monitoring of six boreholes and two test pits, followed  by the excavation of three evaluation trenches.  Archaeological interest in the site is derived from its location close to a number of previous  archaeological investigations, which identified significant Roman activity, including  inhumation burials, as well as preceding Iron Age activity. Within the site parch marks  identified from satellite imagery appear to represent rectilinear enclosures and associated  features.  The results of the archaeological works broadly correlated with parch marks identified from  satellite imagery, with the evaluation identifying ditches corresponding with the rectangular  enclosures. The identified features can be attributed to three main periods, Mesolithic to  Neolithic, late prehistoric, and Roman.  The earliest identified activity on site comprised a pit and ditch containing flint dating to the  Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. Residual pottery, dating to the Late Bronze Age to Early  Iron Age, was recovered from later ditches, indicating the potential for activity of this period  within the site.  The earliest identified features comprised ditches forming elements of rectangular  enclosures, with activity beginning in the Early Roman period with occupation possibly  continuing into the early 3rd century.  Previous archaeological work in the area indicates the potential for a hiatus in activity during  the Late Roman period.

The test pitting and metal detector survey did not produce significant results, although some possibly worked flints were recovered from the soil.    The mitigation excavation demonstrated that the funerary remains did not extend beyond the evaluation trench. Two undated alignments of pits may have formed a corridor or boundary associated with the cremation although any association with the Anglo Saxon period could not be demonstrated. The mitigation area contained a scatter of pits and short linear features concentrated in the south, centre and north-west of the area.

A possible Bronze Age ring ditch was identified to the north-east and worked flint was discovered during metal detecting. Iron Age remains including pits and pottery were found within the proposed development.   The site lies between two Roman settlements on the south-western banks of the River Wensum. One lies nearby to the north-west of the site where numerous finds including coins were recovered. A further Roman settlement lies to the south-east where two enclosures, two kilns and two burials were excavated.  A middle Saxon cemetery, drainage ditches, an enclosure, land divisions and a substantial boundary ditch were recently discovered to the south-east of the site. Saxon metal finds were found to the north-west and to the east.   The site lies beyond the historic core of Great Ryburgh. The medieval settlement developed around the junction of Fakenham Road and Bridge Road to the west of the River Wensum, flanked by the medieval moated manor of Ryburgh at the northern end and by St Andrew's Church to the south.   Cartographic evidence suggests that during the post-medieval period the land was undeveloped farmland.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Following the production of an archaeological desk-based assessment, a geophysical survey, and trial trenching, two portions of the site (Areas A and B) were stripped and excavated. A range of archaeological deposits were encountered and recorded.    The oldest material encountered at the site consisted of a thin scatter of prehistoric flintwork recovered mostly from the overburden. Some of the material appears to be Mesolithic/Neolithic in date and is probably indicative of transient hunter/gatherer activity rather than sedentary agriculture or settlement.    A thin scatter of mostly charcoal-rich pits was encountered in Area B, but the first tangible changes to the landscape occurred in the early Romano-British period when a ditched enclosure was established in Area A overlooking a valley to the north. Material recovered from the enclosure suggests that iron producing bloomery furnace or furnaces were in operation in the vicinity in the first and second centuries AD, although the actual furnace(s) lay outside of the site boundary. A further short stretch of gully of a similar date was encountered at the eastern edge of Area B.    Area B was divided by a field boundary at some time in the medieval or early post-medieval period, and this boundary survived until the excavation of minepits for the extraction of iron ore, which clearly respect its alignment. The minepits were encountered in both of the excavated areas, and showed some localised variation in distribution and character, notably on either side of the fields boundary in Area B, and in three clusters of pits marked by a different methodology of excavation resulting in a distinctly dissimilar plan to the other minepits. Two hearths for roasting ore are presumed to date from this period, possible evidence of on-site quality control of the excavated ore.  </value>

Upper Alluvium covered both the Peat and Lower Alluvial deposits. Made Ground capped the sequence. The Peat was radiocarbon dated from the late Mesolithic to late Bronze Age period.

Six archaeological evaluation trenches were excavated.    The magnetometer survey identified quantities of modern disturbance and failed to detect any potential buried archaeology. As a result the evaluation trenches were not targeted on any geophysical anomalies but were spread as evenly across the site as possible.     Undisturbed subsoil was recorded across the site and this yielded a good quantity of worked flint and 1 sherd of prehistoric pottery. A finely made Neolithic polished axe was also recovered. Some prehistoric pottery dating to the Late Neolithic/early Bronze Age or Late Iron Age/Roman and Middle/Late Iron Age period was also recovered from within two pits. The flintwork and pottery is consistent with that across the Peacehaven area. Several probable field boundary ditches of likely prehistoric date were also encountered across the site. The alignment of some of these ditches suggests they may form part of small scale Middle Iron Age field systems identified to the east and west of the site during previous excavations.      The finds recovered suggest that the site was in use in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age and again in the Middle to Late Iron Age. Possible Mesolithic and Middle Neolithic activity is also probable, as is occupation in the Late Iron Age or Roman period. The activity is difficult to classify but may include both agricultural activity as well as activity peripheral to occupation.  </value>

The high natural gravels found on the site would have formed an island (eyot) in the floodplain of the Tyburn river which would have been attractive to Mesolithic settlers roaming the landscape along channel margins in search of resources.  Ephemeral soils would have formed on the surface of the island and, in areas where these have not been truncated by later piling and basement construction there is the potential for finding artifacts of Mesolithic date.  </value>

The fieldwork was commissioned by Chartway Group Ltd in advance of housing development and associated works. 89 trenches were excavated, a total of 140 features were revealed. The evaluation yielded a large number worked flints dating between the Mesolithic and Iron Age. The earliest cut features were three ditches dated to the Middle Bronze Age, via a pottery assemblage from the Deverel-Rimbury tradition. Boundary division is represented through ditches dating from the Middle Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. Evidence of the Late Iron Age/Early Roman period was recorded in the form of a rectilinear double-ditched enclosure, adjacent to a high-energy water-source, thought to be precluding St Thomas Beckett's Spring. This may be an example of Roman road-site settlement relating to Watling Street. Two large possible extraction pits were recorded adjacent to the enclosure area, thought to be associated with brickearth quarrying. Additional Late Iron Age/ Early Roman pottery assemblages were recovered from ditches further west, though to be continuing fieldscape activity. Perpetuation of pastoral land division was present within a small number of medieval ditches. Two walls, a man-made pond and a metalled trackway of post-medieval date likely remnant of the buildings of Stones Farm were recorded.

Instead the excavation uncovered a group of tree-throw  holes containing a significant assemblage of late Mesolithic flintwork, a possible  ditched enclosure of Bronze Age date and two early-middle Iron Age pits.

<value columnNumber="1">The evolution of humananimal relationships in central England is reviewed. In the Mesolithic, the main focus was on the hunting of large game. The earliest phase of a productive economy is poorly documented but the more mature Neolithic sees a strong focus on husbandry, with hunting playing a subsidiary role. Although milk was already consumed in the early Neolithic, other secondary products and services, such as wool and traction, only began to be used in later prehistory. The early Bronze Age also witnessed the introduction of the horse, transforming human mobility. In the late Iron Age, the influence of the Roman Empire becomes apparent through animal improvement and the importation of exotic species. More substantial changes occur within the Roman period, characterised by an emphasis on cattle husbandry and the introduction of new butchery styles. Abrupt changes occurred at the end of the Roman period, such as a return to a more rural, small-scale animal economy and a greater predominance of sheep. Towards the end of the Saxon period, fisheries come to rely heavily on marine species. After the Norman invasion, high-status sites assume greater predominance and wild game becomes an ever more powerful symbol of rank. The medieval period also sees the increased use of different animal parts in industry, with tanning gradually gaining importance, while horning declines. Improvement in meat yield is apparent towards the end of the medieval and in the post-medieval periods. The size of domestic animals gradually increases, to approach that of contemporary breeds.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">  A Community Archaeology project was organised by Archaeology South-East. This report provides the results of the fourth season of archaeological investigation of a 3.7ha field called Little Stiances, located at Sharpsbridge Lane, Newick, East Sussex. This work was carried out in June 2019.    Geophysical and topographic surveys carried out in 2010 confirmed the location of a 'lost' cottage known from cartographic sources and allowed the targeting of test-pits at that location in 2010, 2013 and 2016. Other target areas identified during those surveys, including house platforms and a sunken routeway, were investigated in 2013 and 2016. In 2019 test-pits were again located at the site of the cottage and garden, and on either site of the identified routeway.    Unfortunately work at the site was somewhat curtailed by poor weather, but as in previous years, the 'Cottage Site' produced a variety of finds reflecting the occupation of buildings in that part of the field, mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Finds ranged from elements of the fabric of the building to pottery, clay pipes and domestic items such as buttons.    Test-pits located to the west of the sunken routeway showed a marked concentration of medieval pottery, strongly suggesting the presence of medieval occupation fronting onto the sunken way leading from the road towards the cottage site. A platform to the east of the route, presumed to be the site of a building produced little material.    The recovery of  the usual background scatter of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork from the site highlights the use of the general area by Hunter/Gatherers, and continued to stretch the site's chronology back into prehistory.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Analysis of a thin, black, humic silt overlying an artefact-bearing clay has indicated that the silt was deposited, under conditions of high water table, in late Boreal times. It has been tentatively dated to between 8500 bp (the base) and 8000 bp (the top) on the basis of the pollen evidence, and on comparison with previous palynological studies carried out on similar deposits. The pollen diagram shows that, in spite of relatively crude sampling, good resolution was obtained in the analysis. However, interpretation would benefit greatly from further work with finer sampling. Considerable changes were seen in the vegetation history of the site and these appear to be correlated with very large inputs of charcoal to the sediment. It would appear that Mesolithic peoples occupied the area throughout the period under scrutiny and that they were practising some form of environmental management with fire. The humic silt appears to be homologous with so-called 'peats' of Boreal age recorded from other sites in the Kennet, Lea and Colne Valleys which overlie artefacts of Maglemosian cultures. </value>

The level of this varied from 3.78m OD to 4.10m OD. From the base of each trench three auger holes were drilled to obtain samples for geoarchaeological analysis. The Shepperton flood plain gravels were found approximately 6.7 metres below modern ground level and varied between -2.66m OD to -1.52m OD. Alluvial silt, clay, peat and sand were recorded in the auger survey. Basal deposits have been dated to the Mesolithic period, while another later sample produced a Bronze Age date. The area continued to be affected by water depositional and erosional processes throughout the prehistoric and into the historic period. A substantial horizontal structure lay on the surface of an accretionary soil, which sealed much of the alluvial deposits. This had been built from re-used 17th century boat timbers and formed a solid path or trackway at 1.0mOD and running north-south across what was still very marshy ground prone to episodic flooding. This was buried beneath a soil that represents horticultural activity as well as some domestic waste disposal.

Two areas together amounting to 6.6ha in extent  were excavated.  The earliest remains comprised two flints, both residual within later  deposits. One is only broadly dateable as prehistoric, whilst the  other is a Mesolithic or Early Neolithic blade. A small ring-ditch is  undated but may be prehistoric, and there was also a residual  sherd of Early to Middle Bronze Age pottery and a small  assemblage of later prehistoric pottery, although it is unclear whether the latter material was stratified or residual.  A single Roman inhumation burial was found. The bones were in  very poor condition but radiocarbon assay produced a  determination of cal. AD 125-251.  The majority of the remains relate to what seems to have been a  medieval farmstead, associated with locally produced TF41b  pottery dateable to the mid 11th to early 13th centuries. An  enclosure containing sub-enclosures and may have been the  location of the farm buildings, although, if so, these were been built  in a form that has left no archaeological trace. Other enclosures  may have been for livestock, and there were trackways or  droveways. Palaeoenvironmental remains suggest that the  landscape immediately surrounding the farm was open, although  the wider environment may have been more wooded, perhaps  indicating a wood-pasture landscape on this part of the Severn  vale.   Some of the earlier enclosures were truncated by a large ringditch.  Dating evidence for this suggests that it was in use up to the  mid 13th century, whilst palaeoenvironmental remains from its fills  indicate that it was water filled and was probably a moat. Although  no contemporary internal features were found, it is likely that this  moat enclosed the dwelling of a wealthy peasant or minor member  of the gentry.

The  archaeological works comprised the monitoring of six boreholes and two test pits, followed  by the excavation of three evaluation trenches.  Archaeological interest in the site is derived from its location close to a number of previous  archaeological investigations, which identified significant Roman activity, including  inhumation burials, as well as preceding Iron Age activity. Within the site parch marks  identified from satellite imagery appear to represent rectilinear enclosures and associated  features.  The results of the archaeological works broadly correlated with parch marks identified from  satellite imagery, with the evaluation identifying ditches corresponding with the rectangular  enclosures. The identified features can be attributed to three main periods, Mesolithic to  Neolithic, late prehistoric, and Roman.  The earliest identified activity on site comprised a pit and ditch containing flint dating to the  Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. Residual pottery, dating to the Late Bronze Age to Early  Iron Age, was recovered from later ditches, indicating the potential for activity of this period  within the site.  The earliest identified features comprised ditches forming elements of rectangular  enclosures, with activity beginning in the Early Roman period with occupation possibly  continuing into the early 3rd century.  Previous archaeological work in the area indicates the potential for a hiatus in activity during  the Late Roman period.

Brick, tile and stone rubble debris and ad hoc animal burials are almost certainly associated with the 19th-20th century functioning and/or demise of the Long Lane Farmstead.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This project plan details the methodology and approach for archaeological monitoring of gas mains utility diversion works HP16. The site is located in fields and woodland/scrub land between Water Orton to the east and Coleshill Industrial Estate to the West. Monitoring of the gas works is required to identify the contribution any archaeological remains that are uncovered in the course of the works. The purpose of the project plan is to outline the scope and aims of archaeological monitoring, outline the approach and methodology to be employed, and set out the proposed deliverables. The GWSI Specific Objectives guiding the project plan are Identifying settlement location and patterns for the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, assess the evidence for regional and cultural distinctiveness along the route in the Romano-British period, identify patterns of change within medieval rural settlement from the 11th to 14th century. The monitoring will be carried out by an Archaeological Contractor with the aim of the monitoring to identify and investigate archaeological features, structures, deposits, artefacts and/or ecofacts. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">The project comprises a heritage statement commissioned by North Lincolnshire to inform a proposed development within land at Yeadland Flats, Belton Road, Epworth, North Lincolnshire (hereafter 'the site') located at NGR: SE 78010 04406.  The proposal is for a residential development.  The site comprises an area of open agricultural land on the edge of Epworth. The area was historically part of the open field system of Epworth and retains a number of landscape features diagnostic of its former division into strip fields. The surrounding area has evidence of human activity dating back to the Mesolithic period, and there is a low potential that this extended into the site.  The site has significance as part of a wider landscape of ancient open fields within the Isle of Axholme which whilst non-designated has been previously identified to be of national interest. The site also makes a small positive contribution to the setting of the nearby Grade II Listed Maw's Mill and Epworth Conservation Area, and a key positive contribution to the setting of the non-designated Brook's Mill which borders the site.   Whilst the details of the proposed residential development at the site have yet to be finalised, it is likely that any level of development within the site will result in some level of harm to the historic environment. It is considered that a sensitively scheme could reduce, although not fully avoid, harm through design. Any residual harm will be weighed against the public benefits of the scheme.  </value>

The archaeological and historical background of the site has been previously considered in a Heritage Assessment (AAL 2015) and revealed evidence of activity dating from the Mesolithic to the post-medieval periods within the vicinity, although none from the site itself  The 18 trial trenches excavated across the proposed development area revealed natural sand and clay with glacial and geological features truncated by a series of undated drainage or boundary ditches and a pit.   Four sherds of 13th century pottery were recovered from a modern land drain and probably suggests medieval manuring, indicating that the land was likely to have been agricultural during that period.   The modern features and hardcore layers are likely to have truncated earlier features and deposits, especially to the east of the site adjacent to Trenches 17 and 18.   The evaluation methodology was appropriate to the size and type of project. It has proved that the development would have a limited impact upon the local archaeological resource, although it is possible that similar additional features may be revealed.    </value>

The natural geology was encountered at a maximum elevation of 49.40m AOD in the south-eastern corner of the site, falling away to 39.72m AOD in the south-west corner.     This investigation has succeeded in identifying archaeological features in 18 of the 40 excavated trenches, predominantly focussed towards the south-east corner of the site area.    A very small quantity of residual struck flint and a polished stone axehead suggests some activity of Mesolithic to Neolithic date in the vicinity of the site.     A single archaeological feature was identified as probably of Middle Iron Age date from a small group of pottery. The feature was tentatively interpreted as a pit, however, extensive truncation to both its west and east edges by later pits made its function and form unclear.     Many of the archaeological deposits recorded were of 1st - 2nd century AD Roman date of which some appeared to form part of a north-north-east to south-south-west aligned field system. It cannot be definitively stated without further work that the archaeological remains were or were not associated with a settlement as there was no clear evidence for structures or enclosure, however the quantity of activity within a limited area, combined with the quality of the pottery recovered might suggest that the archaeological remains relate to activity more significant than purely a field system.   </value>

Twenty-three evaluation trenches were excavated across the site, fourteen of which were found to contain archaeological remains of ditches, gullies and pits. A low density of scattered archaeological remains was uncovered throughout the site, with one concentration of remains of apparent Prehistoric, Roman, Saxon and Medieval date identified in the northeast of the site. Consequently, an excavation area was established here.  The c.5,300sq m excavation area exposed a low density of features dating to the Mesolithic to Neolithic/Early Bronze Age periods, although residual struck flint was also recovered from a number of later features across the site. A small concentration of Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age features was  located in the south of the site.  The majority of the recorded remains were of Roman date, primarily 3rd century. A rectilinear field system and related discrete features were modified by the insertion of a rectangular enclosure. The northwest of the enclosure interior was occupied by a concentration of structural features, possibly a hut and associated fencelines. It is speculated that the enclosure was perhaps as a livestock stockade.   A small quantity of Early Saxon features and deposits suggest land use within the remains of the abandoned Roman agricultural landscape.  13th-14th century quarry pits and a complex of interconnecting sinuous gullies, the latter speculated to be the below-ground remains of hedged boundaries, indicate the nature of land use in the medieval period. The lack of post-medieval remains reflects the exclusively agricultural use of the land in recent centuries.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In July 2013, Oxford Archaeology (OA) carried out a field evaluation at Wallingford  Police Station, Reading Road, Wallingford, Oxfordshire (NGR SU 6071 8901).   A single residual flint of Mesolithic or early Neolithic date was the only prehistoric  find. Two fragments of Roman tile were also found, but these two were probably  redeposited. Late Saxon or Saxo-Norman features were found all across the site.  No trace of the church of St Lucian or of any associated graveyard was found, and it  is probable that these do not lie within the site.  A small quantity of pottery of later 12th-13th century date was also found. Later medieval and early  post-medieval material was absent. The difficulty of determining the relationship  between the buried topsoil and the late Saxon and medieval features is probably the  result of cultivation of this soil in the later medieval period, and it is possible that the  site was used as a garden within St John's Hospital. The site probably remained in  cultivation after the dissolution of the Hospital, as no activity of the later 16th or  early 17th century was found.  A number of pits of the late 17th or early 18th century were scattered across the  site. These were probably associated with the Almshouses erected on the adjacent  site in AD1681. Finds include the best examples yet known of the stamps of an  Abingdon clay pipe maker.  The current ground level of the Police Station site is considerably higher than that of  the more recent flats to the north and east,  which may suggest that the ground level has been raised by the importation of  topsoil. The  foundations of the south-west corner of the Cottage Hospital built on the site in  AD1881 were found close to the current frontage, and were in line with those of the  earlier almshouses to the north. As the imported soil was cut by these foundations,  it seems most likely that it was brought in immediately prior to the construction of  the Cottage Hospital.</value>

The archaeology was mostly concentrated within three fields. Finds from the site included worked flint of a late Mesolithic, Neolithic to early Bronze Age date found largely in the topsoil or subsoil on the site or within later features; Iron Age, Roman and early medieval pottery and other finds, and post-medieval pottery, in addition to ceramic building material and animal bone. Curvilinear ditches may relate to two Iron Age dwellings. Burnt bone and iron nails were recovered from the single Roman cremation identified. The most significant finds also included two Roman armlets - one in shale and one in copper alloy -  and an early medieval bead. A 4th century AD coin was recovered from subsoil. </value>

Subsequent Late Saxon/medieval development (the precise chronology cannot be determined from the pottery, though a 10th-12th century probable) saw the laying out of a series of enclosures, of two phases, with evidence for a mixed agricultural economy and apparently small-scale iron production in the vicinity. No structural evidence present (presumably outside site/by road).

Prehistoric remains (Mesolithic to the Bronze Age) found at nearby South Ferriby indicate a seasonal encampment approximately 1km to the north of the new turbine site; excavations in South Ferriby have also identified extensive Roman occupation, with continuity extending into the Saxon period.   The new turbine site lies on the northern boundary of the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Horkstow Roman villa, which was first identified when three large mosaic floors were revealed by labourers digging for a new kitchen garden at Horkstow Hall in the late 18th century. The full extent of the villa complex has yet to be confirmed, with cropmarks indicating the site may extend beyond the landscaped grounds of Horkstow Hall. Cropmarks to the north of the development site indicate a linear settlement, extending towards South Ferriby from the direction of the villa, and are tentatively identified as lining a road between the villa and the riverside settlements.   During excavations, three pits were identified, one of which has been dated to the Roman period by associated artefacts. A number of unstratified finds were also recovered, including Roman pottery, animal bone and slag. Clearly, this small group of features and finds indicate occupation in the vicinity of the development, probably on the periphery of a larger settlement focus.    </value>

The archaeological works comprised two open area excavations at Orchard  Park East (OPE) and Orchard Park West (OPW), designated COP17, and a subsequent  watching brief. The watching brief comprised the monitoring of the excavation of the  drainage ditch corridor between Dunswell Road and North Moor Lane, designated COP18.  The OPE site targeted a 12th to 13th-century post-mill identified during the trial trenching  phase of works of the area, undertaken by ASWYAS in 2017. Little of the mound deposit  remained, although the broad windmill ditch was encountered, which formed two opposing  C-shape segments with causeways at the east-northeast and west-southwest sides. An  additional outer ring ditch associated with the post-mill structure was identified during the  excavations. The cross-trees of the post-mill and their associated foundation cut was not  observed suggesting that the cross-trees may have been positioned not at the base of the  mound but higher up within the clay deposit, similar to the findings at Little Bentley and  Great Bentley, Essex. The OPW site targeted a post-hole and linear feature which contained a Late  Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flint blade. A single, poorly defined ditch feature of probable postmedieval  origin was exposed. The archaeological watching brief revealed drainage ditches of a post-medieval to early modern origin.</value>

The work revealed remains from three periods: later prehistoric, Roman and post-medieval/modern. Prehistoric remains comprised three scatters of worked and fire-cracked flint from the topsoil, together with a small assemblage of residual material from the Roman feature. The character of the assemblage was mixed, and suggested a predominantly Mesolithic or Neolithic origin, with a later prehistoric, perhaps Bronze Age element.  Roman remains comprised a single feature, a 'T-shaped' clay and stone lined pit. A large quantity of fired-clay fragments, together with a significant quantity of Roman pottery probably dating to between AD120-250 was recovered from the fill. Although the feature was similar in shape to a corn dryer, the stone-lined extension was much more suggestive of a water inlet channel than a hearth. In view of this, and the location beside a tidal creek, it seems more likely that the feature was perhaps associated with salt-working.  Post-medieval/ modern remains comprised a mixed assemblage of finds from the topsoil, including WWII shell fragments, modern cartridge cases and a lead bullet and iron fragments.  </value>

The evaluation was undertaken to inform an outline planning  application for the residential development of the site. The fieldwork  comprised the excavation of 60 trenches.  Archaeological interest in the site is derived from its location within  a landscape rich in early prehistoric findspots. Worked flint of  Mesolithic to Bronze Age date has been recovered from fields  located to the immediate south-west of the site (LHER No:  MLE9270; NGR: SP 627 987) and to the south-east at Beauchamp  College (ELE 8634). While excavation and evaluation to the  immediate north of the site revealed a ditch containing Middle to  Late Iron Age pottery, as well as two similar, but undated, ditches.  Previous geophysical survey of the site identified a number of  anomalies representing potential archaeological features,  comprising curvilinear, linear, circular and discrete anomalies  indicative of prehistoric enclosures, house ring gullies, pits,  boundary features and furrows.  This pattern of enclosures predicted by the geophysical survey was  largely confirmed by the evaluation, which identified archaeological  features concentrated in the south-western part of the site within  two distinct areas. The artefactual evidence recovered during the  evaluation suggests that permanent settlement within the southwestern  part of the site began during the Middle to Late Iron Age,  with evidence for settlement in the form of enclosures, boundary  ditches, pits and ring gullies and other settlement features.  Features associated with medieval and post-medieval land use  were also recorded, including a field boundary ditch containing  medieval pottery and the ploughed-out remnants of medieval ridge  and furrow, the remains of the open field system that once  surrounded the settlement at Oadby, which were encountered  across the site.</value>

This work was carried out in May 2016.    Geophysical and topographic surveys carried out in 2010 confirmed the location of a 'lost' cottage known from cartographic sources and allowed the targeting of test-pits at that location both in 2010 and during the second season of investigation in 2013.    This season the 'Cottage Site' again produced a variety of finds reflecting the occupation of buildings in that part of the field, mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Finds ranged from the expected pottery, glass and clay pipes of a post-medieval assemblage, to the bricks and tiles from the demolished buildings, to more 'personal' artefacts such as a Victorian coin, a key, buttons, fragments of shoes/boots and hand tools, as well as a possible element of the cottage's furniture.    Further test-pits were located on earthworks and anomalies from geophysical surveys and cartographic sources. The discovery of the brick floor at one such location strongly suggests the presence of the buried remains from a post-medieval barn shown in a map of 1739 and hinted at in the results of the geophysical survey. The remains have been left in situ.    A scatter of medieval pottery discovered across the site suggests some of the earthworks may date from this era. The recovery of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork highlights the use of the general area by Hunter/Gatherers.</value>

In trenches on the W side of the site, this latter deposit had an orange iron-stained clay and gravel band at its surface, which probably represents higher areas that (at least sporadically) lay above the water. These areas may have provided prehistoric settlers with 'stepping stones' across the edge of the floodplain.  Overlying the clays was a layer of peat and organic clay, possibly representing a Mesolithic or Neolithic land surface. This area would have been attractive to human settlers early in the Holocene, as it provided habitable areas on the edge of the floodplain with access to the river as well as fresh water flowing from the valley side, and recent excavations at Belmarsh West (BWQ08) N of the portal site have uncovered significant Neolithic timber structures. Alluvial clay overlay the organic layer, and was probably laid down by estuarine waters encroaching on the edge of the floodplain.

The site lies within Girvan Mains Roman camps, a  Scheduled Monument. Eleven archaeological features were  recorded. Most of these were small pits forming no clear pattern  and containing no finds to indicate date or function. One of the pits  contained a lithic, an abraded prehistoric pottery sherd, some  industrial residue, and fragments of fired clay and burnt bone,  along with quantities of spelt and emmer wheat, barley and hulled  barley, and oak and alder charcoal, and it may be a small hearth or  may have been located close to a cereal drying hearth. Another of  the pits contained spelt wheat and barley and some fragments of  fired clay and industrial residue. Two larger, adjacent pits were  also recorded, and are likely to be contemporary. Both contained  well preserved charcoal, with alder dominant and smaller amounts  of hazel and oak charcoal; the dominance of alder suggests they are  perhaps Late Neolithic or Bronze Age in date. One of these larger  pits contained several small flint flakes undiagnostic of knapping  technique or date and they may be intrusive. One sherd of abraded  prehistoric pottery, possibly decorated, was recovered. The pits are  considered to be prehistoric in date and are interpreted as fire pits.  An unstratified flint blade has been identified as dating to the Final  Palaeolithic or Early Mesolithic, around 10000 BC.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A program of geoarchaeological fieldwork was instigated incorporating: (1) the monitoring and sampling of selected geotechnical site investigations, (2) the retrieval of two targeted geoarchaeological boreholes, and (3) radiocarbon dating of the peat horizon in selected boreholes. The resultant records were combined with those from existing archaeological/geoarchaeological/geotechnical investigations for deposit modelling purposes (35 records in total). The results of the current investigation demonstrate a sequence of River Terrace Gravels (the Lower Lea Gravel), overlain by floodplain deposits of peat, organic-rich and tufa sediments, and inorganic alluvium (silts and clays). The peat, organic-rich and tufa sediments appear to be located towards the western end of the site, and are recorded in the same area beneath adjacent sites. However, these deposits did not accumulate at the same time: at the Fish Island site the peat dated to the early Mesolithic to Middle Neolothic; elsewhere they dated from the early Neolithic to Medieval period, and early to middle Mesolithic respectively.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological trial trench evaluation was undertaken by MOLA at Field Farm, Northamptonshire, as part of the construction of the HS2 railway. 33 trenches out of 121 contained archaeological features. The trial trenching confirmed the presence of an enclosed Roman settlement that pottery evidence suggested dated to the late 2nd century to 4th century AD, and medieval and post-medieval furrows. The archaeology was mostly concentrated within three fields. Finds from the site included worked flint of a late Mesolithic, Neolithic to early Bronze Age date found largely in the topsoil or subsoil on the site or within later features; Iron Age, Roman and early medieval pottery and other finds, and post-medieval pottery, in addition to ceramic building material and animal bone. Curvilinear ditches may relate to two Iron Age dwellings. Burnt bone and iron nails were recovered from the single Roman cremation identified. The most significant finds also included two Roman armlets - one in shale and one in copper alloy - and an early medieval bead. A 4th century AD coin was recovered from subsoil.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A programme of geoarchaeological monitoring and deposit modelling was carried out at the Canning Town Phase 3 site in order to clarify the nature of the sub-surface stratigraphy, and the nature, depth and extent of any alluvium and peat deposits. In order to address these aims, a total of five geotechnical boreholes were monitored and described in the field, and a programme of deposit modelling undertaken.    The results of the geoarchaeological deposit modelling demonstrate that the site occupies both an elevated gravel island to the north/northwest, and the deeper Gravel topography of one or more (possibly Late Devensian/Early Holocene) channels to the west and southeast. Both of these features appear to be extensions of those identified during previous geoarchaeological investigations in this area. The new deposit model has significantly improved our understanding of these features; the palaeochannel appears to extend in a south-easterly direction across the west and south of the Canning Town Phase 3 site, although the sediments infilling it are relatively coarse-grained, inorganic, and of negligible palaeoenvironmental potential. On this basis, no further environmental archaeological assessment of the sequences at the site is recommended.     The crest of the Gravel island or eyot in the northern area of the site is higher than has previously been identified in this area (0.39m OD), including at 20 Fords Park Road (-0.2m OD; Nicholls et al., 2013), where evidence of Mesolithic and Bronze Age occupation was identified. The Gravel high at the present site is considered to have increased archaeological potential, since such an elevated Gravel island would have represented an area of higher, drier ground raised up above the floodplain and former channel. This greater archaeological potential is considered to be limited to where the Gravel surface rises up above ca. -1m OD, and further archaeological investigation of this area of the site is recommended.</value>

The site lies within an area of proven archaeological potential attested principally by the discovery of some 7000 Mesolithic artefacts associated with burnt animal bone, occasional charcoal and possible structural evidence during excavations nearby in Loughborough Road. Of considerable importance also was the discovery of two pits containing the largest assemblage of Beaker pottery yet found within the county. However, apart from five unstratified prehistoric flints recovered from topsoil, the 25 evaluation trenches opened at Saxelby Road revealed a largely post-medieval arable landscape comprising the remains of ridge and furrow cultivation features and ditches, some of which contained sherds of medieval and post-medieval pottery. The fills of these features were generally consistent with a post-medieval date. The flints almost certainly relate to the material recovered at Loughborough Road, two (Flint 1  and  Flint 3) being similar to the Mesolithic material, the remainder being either Bronze Age (Flint 2  and  Flint 5), again similar to the Loughborough Road finds, or unidentified (Flint 4). None of these flint finds were associated with prehistoric features or deposits and are indicative only of activity on or around the site. Any such indications of prehistoric occupation that had been present would almost certainly have been removed by later agricultural disturbance and potentially also by construction groundworks associated with the opening of the A6006 bypass.</value>

The excavations were part of 'On Landguard Point', an arts project funded by Arts Council England via its 'Artists taking the Lead' programme for the Cultural Olympiad of the London 2012 Olympic Games. The aim of 'Dig and Sow' was to enable members of the public to experience places familiar to them in a new way by excavating in private gardens and other open spaces within living East Anglian communities, searching for archaeological evidence left by people who lived in those communities in the past. Over a single day, about 40 people took part in the excavations in Paston which produced thousands of finds and provided new evidence for the development of settlement in the area from the prehistoric period onwards.  The prehistoric activity in Paston was mainly in the form of flint tool production potentially from the Mesolithic period onwards with small scatters of lithics and quantities of burnt stone that are likely later prehistoric in date. The evidence was limited for both Roman and Late Anglo-Saxon activity within the study area and it seems that the village of Paston was particularly at its peak during the medieval period, although it was quite severely affected by the Black Death. The village recovered into the post medieval but it stayed a small rural settlement on the north Norfolk coast.  By successfully involving members of the public of all ages and backgrounds from within, across and beyond the community of Paston in planning, organising and undertaking the excavations, the 'Dig and Sow' excavations enabled participants to find out more about their local heritage, take part in the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad and enjoy a community event while generating new evidence to inform understanding of the past development of their homes, their community and its wider landscape.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">During March and April 2016, Cotswold Archaeology carried out a geoarchaeological investigation of the medieval/early post-medieval ridge and furrow earthworks and later field boundaries at the site of Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT III), Northamptonshire.     Five hand-dug test pits and twenty-one machine-excavated trenches were excavated across the northern half of the site. The trenches were targeted on remnant ridge and furrow and other earthwork features shown on a LiDAR survey of the site, with the aim of investigating the development of the medieval agricultural landscape.    On the floodplain, a buried soil horizon was encountered beneath the mineralised medieval ploughsoil. This deposit had some of the characteristics of a Boreal soil (i.e. Mesolithic/Neolithic), but pollen analysis suggests that it was probably a cultivated soil. The soil horizon overlay a variety of vegetation features (tree throw hollows etc.), suggesting that the floodplain supported some degree of tree cover prior to clearance for agricultural use. There was no suitable organic material for radiocarbon dating, so the age of the buried soil is uncertain. However, small ditches were also identified beneath the buried soil, probably forming part of an agricultural ditch system of Late Iron Age or Roman date.  It is therefore probable that the buried soil horizon dates to the first millennium AD. Investigation of the medieval ridge and furrow earthworks identified some changes to its organisation during its period of active use, but dating these changes was constrained by the lack of dateable artefactual material and the homogeneity of the subsoil that formed the earthwork features.  </value>

Finds of Mesolithic flintwork indicate intermittent, perhaps seasonal activity on the higher ground overlooking the River Yeo. Several Neolithic pits some containing pottery, flintwork and charred plant remains, a 'working hollow' with in situ knapping evidence were also identified and point to wider use of the landscape during this period.   A few features and residual finds of Beaker and Early Bronze Age date were found. The most significant features include a Beaker pit and two Collard Urn cremations burials. More permanent settlement of the hillside followed during the Middle to Late Bronze Age, characterised by settlement enclosures, landscape boundaries, field systems, trackways, post-built roundhouses and funerary activity. The evidence demonstrates the significance of land tenure during this period and the finds and environmental assemblages provide evidence of the associated domestic and agricultural activities.   Most of the archaeological remains revealed within the development area relate to occupation during the Iron Age and Romano-British periods. The overall assemblage of site-components includes ditched enclosures, field systems, roundhouses and features associated with the processing (grain dryers and ovens) and storage (four-post structures) of cereal crops. There is also some evidence of funerary activity in the form or isolated cremation burials and inhumation graves, although only the burnt bone survives.

The Late Devensian Shepperton Gravel forms the platform upon which Holocene sediments, containing a complex sequence of Alluvium and Peat, have accumulated. At least three distinct episodes of Peat formation are recorded across the site, the accumulation of which began during the Late Mesolithic, Early Neolithic and Middle Bronze Age in QBH1. Peat horizons recorded in boreholes QBH2 and QBH3 may or may not be contemporaneous with these horizons, but are likely to have accumulated during the widespread period of accumulation recorded elsewhere across the Lower Thames Valley, between ca. 6500-3000 cal BP (equivalent to Devoy's (1979) Tilbury III Peat). On the basis of the nearby investigations at the Cable Car South Station (Batchelor et al., 2012) and the relatively thin and discontinuous nature of the Peat at the GPCE site, no further environmental archaeological analysis is recommended.

The site represents a palimpsest of Early Holocene activity. The grid excavation has revealed an Early Holocene land surface that consists of a sandy deposit with equivocal boundaries. This deposit - sealed by a possible colluvium - has been disturbed by anthropogenic and natural factors, but it contains a significant quantity of prehistoric finds; principally lithics (unburnt and burnt) but also some pottery. The prehistoric finds are essentially Mesolithic and Neolithic in date, but a few Early Bronze Age pieces were also recovered. A pit and two less-well defined pits were found. It is difficult at this stage to date and interpret pit [19] with confidence, but it could be Neolithic and its assemblage could represent a placed deposit.     The first horizons encountered during machining below the tarmac and crushed chalk consisted of humic sandy loam topsoil and silty sand subsoil. They contained a wide array of non-prehistoric finds. Their dispersal and poor condition suggest that the area was possibly used for arable purpose. Some finds are also likely to derive from further up-slope. In preparation for the grid excavation the site had been under-stripped down to the possible colluvium, and the assemblage of non-prehistoric finds was therefore recovered from the possible colluvial deposit and as intrusive from the underlying palaeosoil. The earliest of these finds dated to the Late Saxon period.     Of great interest is the preliminary method used to untangle the mixed assemblage of prehistoric finds and better understand the taphonomic history of the site.   </value>

A locally-present horizon of peat is recorded within the alluvium in selected boreholes, lying at elevations of between ca. 0.4 and 1.8m OD and present in thicknesses of between 0.10 and 1.30m; the patchy, generally thin nature of the peat is consistent with other investigations in this area of the Lea Valley: peat horizons broadly equivalent in depth, but of variable age (including Mesolithic through to Medieval), have been recorded at other nearby sites. </value>

The presence of flint tools and flakes hints at human activity in the late Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age (up to 8000 years ago).  However, the first substantive evidence for activity on the site dates to the early Iron Age (2700 years ago) when a major boundary was constructed.  This was modified in the middle Iron Age and endured, in some form, into the Roman period. Despite the presence of this boundary only limited evidence for middle and late Iron Age activity was identified.  In contrast, the area was intensively occupied in the Roman period (2000 years ago) when there were two settlements (one on each side of the Brook), fields and dispersed activity that included isolated burials.  The settlement to the north of the Brook is interpreted as a planned rural village - a type that is rarely identified in Roman Britain.  The only evidence for post-Roman settlement was an isolated early Saxon building to the south of the Brook.  By the medieval period the area fell within the open field systems of the nearby townships of Harrowden and Cardington.

The project was commissioned by RPS (previously CgMs) on behalf of Crest  Nicholson, in advance of a proposed residential development.  An assemblage of Mesolithic flint was recovered from a tree throw in the eastern part of the site. This  was dominated by small blade debitage, and tools suggesting that flintknapping was carried out there  indicating the presence of a small temporary shelter, probably using the natural cover of a fallen tree.  Mesolithic flint was also recovered from another pit and potential activity of this period was noted  previously from a site to the east.  Evidence of medieval activity was fairly limited in most of the trenches, although one area of more  intensive activity was identified in the south-western part of the site. The activity largely dated to the  13th to early 14th century, and comprised of what appeared to be a pond, several other discrete  features including a possible well, a short ditch, as well as an undated fence line. All the features were  located to the west of a medieval ditch, which probably marks the boundary of an enclosure that was  partially exposed during the works.  The two surveys recorded the surviving features, and analysis of lidar data supplemented these  results. Most of the features surveyed were probably post-medieval field boundaries although a small  number may have their origins in the medieval period.

The works, a condition of planning permission being granted by Eastleigh Borough Council (Planning Reference O/13/73707 and R/14/75539) totalled 1.3 ha. Comprising two large areas (Areas 1 and 2), and seven smaller areas (Areas 3-9) approximately 20 x 20 m, they were subject to strip map and record excavation. A watching brief was also maintained during access road and swale groundworks.     A subcircular feature of unknown function contained a Mesolithic tranchet axe (c. 8500-4000 BC) and fragments of charred hazelnut shells. Further Mesolithic flints were recovered from the subsoil, and residually from later features.    A group of three Middle Bronze Age cremation graves containing urned burials, of which two were radiocarbon dated to 1620-1300 cal. BC. All three urns were inverted and damaged by ploughing, but well preserved. A small pit contained three sherds of possibly Middle Bronze Age pottery along with three pieces of struck flint and burnt flint. Further late prehistoric sherds were also found residually in other features.     A long curving gully pre-dates a Romano-British ditch and may also be of later prehistoric date. Late Iron Age/early Romano-British pottery and Romano-British tile were recovered from a small number of features in Area 1, including two ditches possibly forming part of a small Romano-British enclosure with a group of intercutting pits.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Archaeological Research Services Ltd was commissioned by Tolent Construction Ltd to undertake a scheme of archaeological works on land at South Seaham, County Durham. The scheme of works comprised a desk-based assessment and a geophysical survey followed by a scheme of evaluation trenching. A single trial trench was excavated in February 2018, targeting a late prehistoric circular ditched enclosure highlighted both by the geophysical survey and by crop marks visible in aerial photography. This trench was designed to test the results of the geophysical survey and to assess the level of survival, nature, and date of the enclosure, thus informing a subsequent Written Scheme of Investigation for further stages of evaluation trenching.   This report details the results of Phase I of the archaeological evaluation trenching, which comprised 51 trenches, located in four fields immediately south of the A182.Of the 51 trenches excavated, only ten contained any archaeological remains. Trench 35 contained the aforementioned enclosure ditch as well as three gullies relating to a rectilinear structure within the enclosure. This structure was likely a later addition to the enclosure, representing a later re-use phase. The remaining trenches contained five, post-medieval field boundary ditches and a modern canine burial within the topsoil. A single residual Mesolithic flint was recovered from a plough scar in the topsoil but no other significant finds were recovered.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">This report presents the results of an archaeological evaluation undertaken in respect to proposed mineral development at South Borland, Dunragit, Dumfries  and  Galloway (centred on NGR: NX 17800 57190).     Due to the presence of steeply sloping ground, standing water and live services, the development area was reduced from 16.80ha to 10.64ha. An 8% (4,256 linear metres) sample of the area was investigated by the evaluation.    The evaluation revealed the presence of significant archaeological remains in the form of a later prehistoric ring-groove structure, a flint rich deposit of Mesolithic date and a cluster of truncated cremation pits and post-holes. Human bone and two shards of decorated Beaker pottery were recovered from the cremation pits.  The archaeological remains were localised, being restricted to a low rise at the edge of the coastal fringe. A single shard of unstratified medieval ceramic was also recovered from this area.    Topsoil was relatively thin across the site with pockets of colluvium occurring in many of the lower lying trenches. Sub-soil consisted of free draining sands and gravels. Given the significance of the archaeological remains further mitigation will be considered necessary.  </value>

The archaeological remains encountered during the excavation represented a period of human and environmental activity from the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic to the late Iron Age.     Geologically the excavation area was underlain by Alluvium associated with the river Thames noted at -3.10m OD. This was overlain by a 2.4m of peat formation which in turn was overlain by alluvium.   Fragments of struct and burnt flint, recovered from the lower alluvium represented the human activity in the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic. Worked timbers with tool cuts recovered from the upper peat formation indicated a period of activity from the Bronze Age.   A series of late Iron Age ditches, pits and postholes that cut into the upper alluvial deposit were the latest evidence of human activity noted on site.    Modern deposits directly sealed the archaeological remains and represented the current ground level. A series of modern intrusions truncated the archaeological features and underlying natural strata.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Twenty trenches were excavated for Phase 1 of the development at The Embankment, Peterborough.     The site is archaeologically sensitive, with a Mesolithic palaeochannel to the east, and Bronze Age find spots to the south. The Car Dyke, a Roman canal or drain ran approximately north-south to the east of the site boundary and Roman period finds are known to the north. An abbey dating to the Saxon period lay to the immediate northwest of the site, in the area that is now occupied by the Peterborough Cathedral precinct. Aside from a grange documented in the 1300s, and still evident as a moated site on 19th century maps (shown at the eastern extent of the site and now largely beneath the Frank Perkins Parkway), the site remained as undeveloped farm land until the latter part of the 20th century when the northern portion of it was developed with leisure facilities and associated car parks.     The stratigraphic sequence recorded in the trenches comprised natural clay and alluvium sealed by a thick deposit of 19th/20th century waste material. Over this were levelling layers beneath a car park surface. Four undated possible tree throws and pits were identified, each of these features was cut into the natural and sealed by the 19th/20th century dumped deposit. A representative sample of finds from this layer comprised 36 glass and four pottery vessels, which were predominantly early to mid-20th century in date. There were no finds or features to suggest the presence of earlier activity.  </value>

The site is centred at TQ 5402 7383. It was carried out initially over four days between 24th and 27th April 2020 and completed by a 'strip, map  and  sample' exercise undertaken over twenty-one days between the 6th of May and the 5th of June 2020.  Initially, a single trench (5m by 1.8m) was excavated by machine until it exposed a layer of natural sandy clay which was found to contain worked flint at 5.31m OD, whereupon machining was halted.  . Natural deposits of Taplow Gravels [5] were located at 4.55m OD. and further examined for Palaeolithic remains.Whilst a small quantity of struck flints were recovered, they were interpreted as being intrusive.    The gravels were covered by two layers Holocene or post-Holocene alluvium.  Layer [4] was recorded at 5.01m OD sealed by layer [3] which contained substantial quantities of struck flint. Although a Mesolithic-style tranchet axe was recovered from layer [3], the bulk of the flint work was of a  poor quality, suggesting a LBA to EIA date.  A layer of dark grey clayey silt, interpreted as a garden or horticultural soil was exposed at 5.57m OD It was dated to the Post medieval period when the study area was occupied by a series of fields, orchards and horticultural plots according to the map regression exercise.  Modern disturbance and truncation consisted of a series of concrete pads related to the construction of a warehouse or industrial unit during mid 20th century. Small areas of disturbance consisted of animal burrowing [8], a small pit [10] and a modern dog burial [13].   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A programme of geoarchaeological field investigations was undertaken at the site of the Martin Baker New Access Road, Higher Denham, Buckinghamshire. The results demonstrate a sequence of Shepperton Gravel with a surface at levels between 43.45 and 44.77m OD, overlain in four of the six test pits by calcareous Alluvium between 0.4 and 1.0m thick and with an upper surface of between ca. 44.4 and 45.2m OD. These deposits are considered to represent sediment accumulation on the floodplain of the River Misbourne during the Holocene, within low energy fluvial and/or semi-aquatic conditions at a distance from any active channels with a colluvial input from the east side of the valley. No organic sediments or biological remains were observed within the Alluvium, other than modern root material from the overlying topsoil.    During the geoarchaeological investigations a moderately large assemblage of struck flint and a small quantity of unworked burnt stone were recovered, in all cases from the topsoil or subsoil (forming in to the Gravel or Alluvium). The main significance of the struck flint assemblage is that it demonstrates flintworking activities occurring at the site, certainly during the Mesolithic period and perhaps during the Neolithic but with the majority of the pieces being most characteristic of Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age industries.     In the absence of any buried soil horizons, organic or tufaceous-rich deposits, no further geoarchaeological or paleoenvironmental investigations are recommended (pending the results of the investigations of the western part of the site, to which no access was possible at this stage of the work). In terms of the current lithic assemblage, due to the size of the struck flint assemblage and lack of contextual associations, this report and accompanying catalogue is all that is required for the purposes of archiving and no further analytical work is warranted.   </value>

The archaeological features and artefacts recorded during the Phase 3 evaluation suggest that this area of the site contains a small amount of low density archaeological remains the majority of which remain undated. The Mesolithic and Neolithic worked flints collected from the topsoil of trenches suggests a background level of activity during these periods. The large deep pit recorded to the south-east of the Phase 3 (Trench 40) area is of likely prehistoric date, but some uncertainty remains as only one worked flint was found in its fills. Based on its form this feature may represent a storage pit but given the lack of associated archaeological features identified in adjacent trenches this interpretation remains uncertain. In the south of the area a field boundary ditch was investigated in two trenches (45 and 47) and accords well a boundary shown on the 1874 First Edition Ordnance Survey map. Other features included small isolated pits and postholes that were undated and an undated tree-throw hole.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">This Heritage Statement has been prepared for a site at Heron's View, Normans Bay, East Sussex in order to establish the likely presence and importance of any archaeological remains, and to identify any original features of the building, that may be affected by the proposed change of the former workshop and store into a residential dwelling.    It has been established that the Site contains low archaeological potential prior to the Post Medieval period, as a result of its likely marshland setting from the Mesolithic period through to the Bronze Age and its submerged location from the Iron Age through to the medieval period, when reclamation of the marshes first began to take place. Historic maps of the late 18th century onwards have been most informative on the development of the Site and its surrounding locality. From the cartographic evidence, the building on Site dates to at least 1873. The River Board owned the building in 1946, which may suggest that it was originally built to keep the sluice gates operational.    The Historic building was originally associated with the management of the adjacent sluices in the later 19th century, and during World War II was incorporated into an Emergency Coastal Battery. The Historic fabric of the structure has been recorded, and the level of recording is considered sufficient to allow the building to now be converted to a residential dwelling, however some monitoring may be required during the development to record the adjacent gun position.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The archaeological investigation consisted of initially A Watching Brief which oversaw the removal ofexisting petrol tanks under the former 20th century garage forecourt, a second phase which comprised two evaluation trenches and two test pits and finally a mitigation excavation to the south of the site. The underlying gravel terraces were recorded at their highest at 0.01m OD and at their lowest at -3.16m OD. The fall in the height is interpreted as a natural contour within the gravel terrace formed by a paleochannel which occupied the northern part of the site. Nascent foreshore formation layers were detected, followed by substantial peat growth. The peat attained a thickness of 1.90m and struck flint was recovered from the surface. The struck flint dated to between the Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic periods. The peat was capped by a layer of blue-grey alluvial clay, a phase of inundation referred to as the 'Iron Age Transition.'  This had been subsequently sealed by a layer of Aeolian-derived clayey-sand into which a number of superficial features had been cut. A ring gully, large oval pit and a natural hollow all produced varying quantities of burnt and struck flint and fragmentary, degraded animal bone but no dateable artefacts, although it is suggested the features were of prehistoric or Roman date. This comprised the putative 'dry zone' to the south.    The land surface was sealed by a relict soil horizon which may relate to early horticultural exploitation of the dry land zone. Formation may have occurred at any time from the Late Iron Age to the medieval period - but prior to post-medieval land reclamation.    The sequence was concluded by the introduction of made ground containing fragmentary finds dating predominantly to the 19th century. The raising of the ground preceded the construction of terraced housing fronting both St James's and Rolls Roads. A short section of wall relating to these buildings was exposed in Test Pit 1.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Six flint flakes were retrieved, all from secondary locations, either within the deposits in the trial trenches, or from animal burrow up-cast within the immediate vicinity of the trenches. No intact buried soil horizons preserving in-situ Mesolithic or Prehistoric occupation were identified either by the auger survey or the trial trenches. The presence of several flakes in the vicinity of the trenches confirms the probability of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer activity in the location. However, the low density of the finds indicates that either a) our research has not pin-pointed an exact locus of occupation or more likely b) the site has been disturbed by later bioturbation and slope processes. The low density of lithic material is probably indicative of transitory occupation.     Pook's Pulpit is likely to be typical of other localities within the valley where Mesolithic hunter gatherers, moving through the landscape utilised the rock as setting for short term camps for short periods of time. The work helps to bring the central Weald in general, and localities like Nymans in particular into focus as an important research area for future field investigation.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">archaeological works undertaken in respect of proposed development works on land at Sherifflatts, Thankerton, South Lanarkshire (centred on NGR: NS 97423 37427). The proposed works comprise: formation of a single house plot (planning reference no.CL/18/0013).     The plot of ground proposed for development is located in an area with a reasonably high potential to produce significant archaeological material, an interpretation that is based on the distribution of recorded sites and artefacts that have been identified in the surrounding landscape. Most visibly, this is demonstrated by the presence of a fort and enclosure in the area around 800m to the south-west of Sherifflats, both of which are legally-protected as scheduled monuments. However, within closer proximity to the development plot a large number of sites relating to occupation during the prehistoric period have been recorded (which include: a food vessel, several cinerary urns, and a number of unassociated cremation deposits). A variety of finds spanning from the Late Mesolithic to the 19th century, in the form of chert wasters and a chert cutting tool to an assemblage of clay tobacco pipe stems and bowls, were also recovered from close to the development site.     The archaeological works comprised monitoring of topsoil, to a clean subsoil surface, from the footprint of the dwelling house and access / parking area.

<value columnNumber="1">During June to August 2017 Oxford Archaeology South undertook two stages of trial trench evaluation at Buckton Fields West, to the north of Northampton. In total 41 trenches were opened across the site, targeted on the results of a geophysical survey, and to test 'blank areas'. The evaluation uncovered evidence for activity from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods in the form of isolated struck flints, and also of middle Iron Age date, although this was limited to a few features. Evidence for occupation of the site during the later Iron Age into the early and   middle Roman periods was more extensive and took the form of a fairly extensive array of ditches and pits focused on the central and western parts of the evaluated area. The pottery from several of these features was recovered in fairly large sherds and appeared unabraded, suggesting that it was deposited in the vicinity of settlement. The presence of imported pottery   suggests a site of at least moderate status. Fired clay derived from a domestic oven or related to crop processing, and also possibly from a metalworking furnace was present, as were the remains of fallow deer, which are very rare from Romano-British contexts. The presence of axially split cattle bones also from Roman contexts may indicate that specialist butchery was carried out within the site. Waterlogged material of probable Roman date was present in a lower lying area within in the south-western part of the site. Several trenches contained closely spaced parallel ditches, which did not have the form of medieval or later plough furrows. These were present on several alignments, and where dated contained Roman material. These could represent arable cultivation of Roman date. </value>

A small assemblage of Later Mesolithic flint was retrieved from the north-eastern part of the site.    Three spreads of heat cracked stones were revealed in the north-western field, dated by a sherd of Middle Iron Age pottery.  Several Middle Iron Age ditches and pits and an associated round house were revealed in the north-eastern fields, which have been interpreted as a small Iron Age farmstead.   The main focus of Roman activity was also in the north-eastern fields, but there was no evidence for continuous occupation from the Middle Iron Age.  Four Romano-British features may represent modest buildings. There were also several pits and a number of boundary ditches indicative of a small rural settlement but the pottery assemblage contained a significant amount of fine wares that would ordinarily be associated a villa and there were also small fragments of hypocaust tile, roof tile and brick.  A cremation burial was revealed to the west of these features.     A second focus of Romano-British activity was found in the north-western field, again proximal to Middle Iron Age features.  This consisted a smaller number of pits and ditches than seen in the eastern fields.      Furrows were recorded in most trenches and several post-medieval clay pits were revealed to the western half of the farm. No dating evidence was found in the excavated furrows and there was a general lack of medieval or post-medieval material in the plough soils. The ploughed-out ridge and furrow has been mapped using the results of the trial trenching combined with aerial mapping.    The trial trenching has established that significant archaeological deposits are present from several periods, and that they would be impacted by any future development.  </value>

The development area is located within the historic core of Hinckley (SP 42907 94157).  The lower courses of brickwork, a well, and two cellars from seven adjoining terraced houses and their outbuildings were excavated.  These fronted onto 'New Buildings' dating from 1782 based on the cartographic evidence.  The excavation revealed two separate main phases of construction with houses 32 and 34 being built first, followed by houses 36-44.  The well was in situ before the construction of this second phase of buildings as the cellar of house number 40 was constructed over part of it.  The outbuildings were mostly crudely constructed using mixed materials and two houses had outside toilets.  Finds include; a single Mesolithic small blade-like flint flake, a cast iron axe head (hatchet), and several coins with the earliest being a silver 1933 one shilling coin of the uncrowned George V,  many pottery fragments with the earliest being a roman jar rim, and multiple fragments of pottery c.17th -18th to modern in date. The dating of these finds showed evidence of the development of the historic core of the town in the modern periods, whilst the presence of Mesolithic flint and Roman pottery would suggest earlier activity within the vicinity of the site and that there had been occupation of this area from the Mesolithic to present day.

A total 12.54ha of fieldwalking survey were completed and 78 of the originally proposed 81 evaluation trenches were excavated.  The work recorded Mesolithic to post-medieval artefacts from across the site in varying quantities, as well as recovering (mostly) residual prehistoric worked and burnt flint. In some cases these unstratified finds corresponded with sub-surface archaeological features during the evaluation, particularly Neolithic/Bronze Age activity in the area of a ploughed-out barrow ring-ditch of Middle/Late Bronze Age or earlier date in the northwest of Field C. Prehistoric activity was represented by concentrations of (mostly Bronze Age) worked flint and burnt flint recorded in the south-west and north-east of Field B. Another concentration of Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age activity is represented by a distribution of mostly unstratified worked and burnt flint and pottery in the south of Field C, probably from activity centred on the high ground at the very south-eastern part of the site.  Roman activity of at least 2nd - 3rd century AD date, including pits and ditches, as well as unstratified artefacts were concentrated on the high ground on the west side of the site. Medieval activity is represented by a very small number of 12th - 15th century pottery sherds dispersed across the site.  Most of the post-medieval and modern material (16th century and later) recovered comprises ceramic building material spread out across the fields as a result of ploughing or through deliberate dumping such as from construction of the A339.

The area is required as part of the construction land requirements for the enabling works and subsequent main works for HS2 Phase One. The mitigation examined an area of archaeological remains found during an earlier trial trench evaluation, comprising ditches and pits, which produced a small assemblage of worked flint and some pottery of Late Bronze Age/Iron Age and Roman date. The earliest datable evidence from the mitigation was a flint scatter dating to the Late Mesolithic period, providing evidence for tool manufacture and domestic activities. Environmental evidence consistent with plant exploitation activities dating to the same period was also recovered. A small assemblage of Late Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age pottery, indicative of rural settlement activity, was recovered from two pits. A small assemblage of Late Iron Age/Roman pottery and CBM was recovered from ditches in the west of the mitigation area. Two parallel ditches may represent a trackway of  Late Iron Age/Roman date. A copper alloy brooch fragment and an illiterate copy of a nummus of Constantine were recovered during metal detecting. Cultivation furrows to the south-west and north-east of the mitigation area may relate to an agrarian landscape associated with Milburn Grange DMV.

Has demonstrated that a series of cropmarks represent features associated with Iron Age settlement and also that the settlement extends further to the north and north-west than the cropmarks suggested.     Despite significant recent truncation and disturbance by modern construction and demolition activities many of the features exhibit good survival: one pit was almost 1m deep. Ceramic finds bear a close resemblance to those recovered during previous excavations on the site, and it is anticipated that further analysis will indicate an early-middle Iron Age date for many of the excavated features.     Flintwork recovered from the subsoil in many trenches indicate background earlier prehistoric activity, most likely during the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic, while a possible ditch in the south-west corner of the site could date from the Roman period.     </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Evaluation (January 2019) comprised of six trenches with the remains of 19th century buildings and suggested earlier remains underneath. Mitigation work in two SMS areas was undertaken between May and June 2019.  Natural geological deposits consisted of friable, loose sands and gravels with a palaeochannel located in the north eastern section of site. Overlying the gravels were deposits of dark organic-smelling clayey sands with silts suggesting deposition within a wet environment, suggested as evidence of the documented roadside pond by Scarbrook Road.  The prehistoric phase consists of 11 features including a possible structure, post holes and small pits with a later small ditch. Finds retrieved were lithics including worked tools which indicate a date on the Mesolithic to Neolithic transition period, and some degraded cereal remains from one pit.  The early post-medieval phase consists of the remains of two buildings, with several boundary walls, a drain and yard surfaces with small pits and postholes in the north east of the site. Further surviving walls, postholes and surfaces survived adjacent to Scarbrook Road. Few finds were retrieved but the dating suggests the early post-medieval period.  The late post-medieval phase consists of surviving cellars on Wandle Road built between 1780 and the early 19th century and terrace houses along Scarbrook Road built early to mid-19th century which survived into the 1960s. The finds was dominated by lithics, with post-medieval pottery, glass, bricks and tiles with some domestic objects including coins  The site remains are suggested as being of regional significance for the prehistoric phase due to the paucity of evidence from this period in the area and of local significance for the post-medieval periods which will shed light on the development of Croydon within the hinterland of London.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The earliest remains at Clifton Quarry, Worcestershire, included residual Mesolithic flints but the most significant early prehistoric remains were a group of Late Neolithic pits, one of which contained an elaborate collection of six whole or fragmentary polished axes, numerous flint tools and debitage, significant quantities of Grooved Ware pottery (Durrington Wall and Clacton Styles), abundant charred barley grains and crab apple fragments. Radiocarbon dating indicates that material was deposited around 2900-2600 cal BC.      Activity during the Bronze Age activity focused around a burnt mound, trough and associated features that were also filled with heat shattered quartz pebbles in a rich charcoal matrix. Radiocarbon dates suggest this activity was seasonal and short-lived, beginning around 1410-1305 cal BC and ending around 1370-1255 cal BC; a period of between 1-140 years.     The quarry also contained an Early to Middle Iron Age settlement. This contained 678 postholes and 130 pits, with the latter being clustered into three distinct groups. The majority of the postholes belonged to an estimated 103 buildings, thought to be raised granary stores (four-post structures). The rich charred grain assemblage recovered from these structures suggests that both spelt wheat and barley were stored at the site, both as cleaned crops and in spikelets.      Early medieval deposits consisted of double-ditched field boundaries and a timber-lined well constructed from roundwood stakes and cleaved planks. Dendrochronological analysis has shown that some of these timbers were felled in the years 704/5 AD and radiocarbon dates suggest that the well filled rapidly after construction.       </value>

<value columnNumber="1">A geoarchaeological evaluation was conducted by Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd at Instone House, Dartford, Kent, DA1 2JP undertaken over two days between 24th and 27th April 2020.  A single trench, measuring 5m by 1.8m, was excavated followed by the sinking of a sondage (measuring 1.8m by 1.5m) at the north-east end. Natural deposits of Taplow Gravels were located at 4.55m OD within the trench sondage. The gravels, laid down in the Pleistocene Period, were further excavated and examined for Palaeolithic remains, and while a small quantity of struck flint was recovered, they were interpreted as being intrusive.  Excavation continued to a depth of 3.21m OD revealing further layers of sand. The gravels were covered by two layers of sandy clay which appeared to derive from Holocene or post-Holocene alluvium.  They commenced at 5.81m OD, the lower of which was archaeologically sterile. The upper layer, which appeared to have been reworked, contained substantial quantities of struck flint. Although a Mesolithic-style tranchet axe was recovered, the bulk of the flint work was poor quality suggesting a LBA to EIA date making it an intrusive piece but one that hinted at earlier activity on the alluvium. A layer of dark grey clayey silt, interpreted as a garden or horticultural soil, was exposed at 5.57m OD and was 0.24m thick beneath the modern made ground of concrete and tarmac. Fragmentary pottery and CBM dated this horizon to between the 17th to 19th centuries.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In 2019 Wessex Archaeology excavated 354 trenches. The most significant remains date to the Late Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age and Romano British periods. Area 1 occupied occupied a ridge overlooking the tributary of the Finham Brook and contained boundary ditches, cremated human remains and a hearth all probably of Romano British date. Area 2 lay to the southeast of the A429 and contained further boundary ditches with pottery of Late Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age date, set against a potential backdrop of prehistoric flintworking dated to the Neolithic or Bronze Age. Isolated features found elsewhere included probable post medieval and modern boundary or drainage ditches and hedgerows and undated pits.    The earliest dateable evidence from the trial trenching was 12 pieces of worked stone indicative of sporadic prehistoric activity (note: mitigation excavation later revealed a regionally significant Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic camp). The modest finds assemblage consists mostly of pottery with smaller quantities of other materials including cremated human bone. Soil samples were generally uninformative.    In 2020, 79 further trenches were excavated, revealing ridge and furrow and other agricultural features as well as a few other undated features. The 2020 finds assemblage was of negligible intrinsic worth and no soil samples were taken.  </value>

Nine areas (Areas A-I), covering 3.71 ha, were excavated in four stages between 2017 and 2019. The watching brief monitored cable duct excavations and groundworks/landscaping, yielding no archaeologically significant information.  The excavations uncovered prehistoric remains including a sparse scatter of Neolithic and Bronze Age features (Areas B-C) and a large tree-throw hollow containing over 1400 pieces of Mesolithic worked flint and 80 kg of burnt flint (Area I).   Three Middle/Late Iron Age enclosures occupied the higher ground in the southern part of the development area. These included, in Area A, the remainder of a banjo enclosure partially excavated in 2008 (Phase 1 Area 6). The remains of three probable roundhouses were found within the enclosure, along with numerous pits and postholes. Another sub-rectangular enclosure, to the north-west in Area D, included potentially contemporary associated pits and postholes, together with the remains of at least one roundhouse. The third, ostensibly an open-ended/U-shaped enclosure, located in Area G was subject to very limited excavation, although sufficient to confirm its broad contemporaneity with the other enclosures.   Little evidence of Romano-British activity was identified, except a few ditches and pits in Area I.

<value columnNumber="1">The archaeological investigation consisted of initially A Watching Brief which oversaw the removal ofexisting petrol tanks under the former 20th century garage forecourt, a second phase which comprised two evaluation trenches and two test pits and finally a mitigation excavation to the south of the site. The underlying gravel terraces were recorded at their highest at 0.01m OD and at their lowest at -3.16m OD. The fall in the height is interpreted as a natural contour within the gravel terrace formed by a paleochannel which occupied the northern part of the site. Nascent foreshore formation layers were detected, followed by substantial peat growth. The peat attained a thickness of 1.90m and struck flint was recovered from the surface. The struck flint dated to between the Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic periods. The peat was capped by a layer of blue-grey alluvial clay, a phase of inundation referred to as the 'Iron Age Transition.'  This had been subsequently sealed by a layer of Aeolian-derived clayey-sand into which a number of superficial features had been cut. A ring gully, large oval pit and a natural hollow all produced varying quantities of burnt and struck flint and fragmentary, degraded animal bone but no dateable artefacts, although it is suggested the features were of prehistoric or Roman date. This comprised the putative 'dry zone' to the south.    The land surface was sealed by a relict soil horizon which may relate to early horticultural exploitation of the dry land zone. Formation may have occurred at any time from the Late Iron Age to the medieval period - but prior to post-medieval land reclamation.    The sequence was concluded by the introduction of made ground containing fragmentary finds dating predominantly to the 19th century. The raising of the ground preceded the construction of terraced housing fronting both St James's and Rolls Roads.

<value columnNumber="1">The results of an archaeological excavation at 'Denbet', Mill Road, Hengrave, Suffolk. The site is situated in the immediate vicinity of the Fornham Cursus (FAS 004), parts of which are a Scheduled Monument (SF 114).    The positioning of the initial evaluation trench at 'Denbet' was very fortunate in that it happened upon a post-setting which subsequently proved to be part of a very shallow set of features and an area of scorched gravel. Together these features and the worked flint collected from them offer ephemeral evidence for the location of a Mesolithic camp site or temporary shelter. Worked flint was also collected from several shallow hollows in the natural geology close by along with a broader scatter across the site. The overall assemblage includes several exhausted bladelet cores, numerous bladelets, a microlith in the form of an obliquely backed point and a small number of ad hoc scrapers.     Part of a coaxial ditch system was revealed on a north-west to south-east orientation which may be seen as an extension of a past landscape recognised previously to the north and east through extensive cropmarks. Some areas of these ditches were masked by a build-up of cover sands of c. 200mm depth, which may suggest the former presence of a denuded topsoil. The ditches contained occasional residual prehistoric flints but no cultural material which can elucidate further on their date or function. The general form and layout of these ditches does not appear to be consistent with a Neolithic landscape and overall they may be interpreted as being later land divisions set away from settlement, possibly related to pastoral use.   </value>

In order to install the pontoon, the existing rock armour that limits erosion will be removed and four piles will be put installed, utilising a spud-legged crane barge. The rock armour will then be reinstated and inspected by divers to ensure adequate replacement. The Search Area comprises a 1 km buffer around the Brownsea Island proposed pontoon location (or Site) while the Study Area comprises a 50 m buffer around the site. Within the Search Area there are the following features: 13 Grade ll Listed Buildings; seven recorded wrecks in the Dorset Historic Environment Record and National Record of the Historic Environment databases; an anchorage; one submerged findspot and one terrestrial findspot; and potential for buried remains of seabed prehistory dating from the Palaeolithic to the Mesolithic and shipwrecks dating from the Neolithic to modern period. The assessment concludes that, although there is potential for archaeological deposits to be located within the Site, current design proposals indicate that the limited scale of development will have minimal impact.  </value>

There was also potential for Mesolithic flint scatters.  The quarry was mothballed in 2010 but recently reopened and expanded. This  recent expansion began in July 2015 with the stripping of topsoil and  overburden, and was continued in September 2018. A recent phase of  watching brief, the subject of this report, was undertaken in September and  October 2019, and is a further extension of the quarry.  An area measuring approximately 50m wide and 180m long was stripped of  topsoil and overburden. The topsoil consisted of a dark brown peat some 0.3-  0.4m thick, whilst the overburden comprised a mottled yellow plastic clay  0.4m thick merging into blue-grey plastic clay some 0.3m thick.  No features or finds of archaeological significance were noted within the area  of ground disturbance during this and previous phases of fieldwork.  Consequently, the site as a whole seems to be generally of low archaeological  potential, reflecting its use over time for mainly pastoral activities.</value>

The earliest datable evidence from the mitigation was a flint scatter dating to the Late Mesolithic period, providing evidence for tool manufacture and domestic activities. Environmental evidence consistent with plant exploitation activities dating to the same period, but also seen in later periods, was also recovered. A small assemblage of Late Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age pottery, indicative of settlement activity, was recovered from two pits. A small assemblage of Late Iron Age/Roman pottery and CBM was recovered from ditches in the west of the mitigation area.

The earliest find was a single Upper Paleolithic flint blade (40,000 - 10,000BC), followed by a scattered flintwork assemblage dating to the Mesolithic (10,000 - 4,000BC), although no definite features were dated to this period. The first period of definable occupation is dated to the earlier Neolithic (4,000 - c. 3,000BC) and included five oval pits and a gully. Finds from the Neolithic included a small assemblage of flintwork, including a leaf-shaped arrowhead and several fragments of regionally rare Peterborough Pottery. Limited evidence of Early Bronze Age activity was recorded, including a single pit containing pottery. Occupation activity greatly increased in the later Middle Bronze Age (1,600 - 1200BC) and was focused on a double ditched enclosure, associated droveway, pits, a round house and four unurned human cremations. Occupation appears to have continued unabated into the Late Bronze (1200 - 700BC), with a further two roundhouses, pits, and a field system. Finds from the Bronze Age settlement included a notable assemblage of pottery, including one almost complete vessel, struck flint, worked stone and a rare piece of carved chalk. The Bronze Age settlement was abandoned close to the end of the period, c. 700BC. The last activity recorded was a large north to south orientated ditch and a group of large pits dating to the Late Iron Age (800 - 43BC) or early Roman period (43AD - 200).

<value columnNumber="1">In 2014, Central Bedfordshire Council granted outline planning consent for a housing-led urban extension to the north of Houghton Regis-a development known as Houghton Regis North 1 (HRN1).    In relation to part of the Phase 1 AIWt he fieldwork comprised strip, map and sample . The investigations produced evidence for a landscape utilised from the Mesolithic to the present day.  The earliest evidence for human activity comprised up to 16 large pits, three of which were radiocarbon dated to the late Mesolithic after completion of the fieldwork.    Much of the other evidence for past activity is related to settlements, enclosure systems and boundaries found in the adjacent excavations, HRN3455, HRN3456 and HRN3456.  The evidence from the investigation area comprised: a possible segmented enclosure with internal and external activity dated to the middle Bronze Age-early Iron Age; more dispersed ditches and a possible structure dated to the late Iron Age/early Roman period; and field systems dated to the Roman period. Two arrays of furrows were the sole evidence for medieval activity and field-related features of post-medieval date were also found.  The investigated remains and the recovered finds have the potential to contribute to a number of local and regional research themes.  These relate to the evolution of the landscape through time and the nature of activity on the periphery of settlements.  The unexpected identification of the Mesolithic pits will be an important additional research theme because of the rarity of such features although the associated data-sets are small.    </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation across a site located on land west of Southall Lane, Hayes UB2 5HJ.   Part of the site lies within the Cranford and Cranford Moat Archaeological Priority Area as defined by the London Borough of Hounslow. The site was considered to have a high potential for archaeological remains of the later prehistoric period and for evidence of Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Medieval settlement and agricultural activity. Extensive archaeological works carried out to the immediate north of the site revealed significant remains of prehistoric, Roman and Saxon date, including a Neolithic penannular ditched feature, thought to have had a ritual purpose. Bronze Age and Iron Age cemeteries were also recorded.  The evaluation consisted of the excavation of 36 Trenches and the monitoring of 45 Test Pits to ascertain the archaeological potential of the site prior to the submission of planning application to undertake mineral extraction.  Extensive multi-phase evidence was seen across the site dating from the Mesolithic through to the post-medieval periods in the form of pits, ditches, post-holes and levelling activity. Early pottery was notable in the southwest of the site and may suggest a focus of activity in the first millennium BC and early 1st century AD.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">The results of a programme of archaeological work (Strip, Map and Sample Excavation) at Pillbox Farm, Mill Road, Hengrave, Suffolk. The site is situated in the immediate vicinity of the Fornham Cursus (FAS 004), parts of which are a Scheduled Monument (SF 114).     This new trench revealed several additional shallow archaeological features and a continuation of a linear ditch of uncertain date previously recorded just to the west, along with a large cess-tank pit which formerly served the demolished property known as Denbet.    A cluster of three prehistoric pits containing burnt flints and charcoal stained deposits in the form of buried hearth waste was investigated, with a small number of burnt and unburnt worked flints also retrieved from their fills. Most significantly C14 dates established for one of the pits places the activity to 2992BC +/- 24 years, within the middle Neolithic date range (3,200 to 2,800 BC). This is a period when the landscape was dominated by the adjacent cursus monument.    A small assemblage of just 11 worked flints were collected, evidence for prehistoric activity of primarily Neolithic date. Unlike the previous assemblage from the house excavation, no evidence attributable to Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic bladelet technology was collected. Other noteworthy include a late 16th to early 17th century jetton, a 17th century Rose farthing and a trading token of Confectioner and Bakers called Wilsons dated to 1839 and bearing the city of Norwich arms.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">A pre-determination archaeological evaluation on land at Sywell Aerodrome, Northamptonshire, on behalf of Sywell Aerodrome Ltd. Has demonstrated that a series of cropmarks represent features associated with Iron Age settlement and also that the settlement extends further to the north and north-west than the cropmarks suggested.     Despite significant recent truncation and disturbance by modern construction and demolition activities many of the features exhibit good survival: one pit was almost 1m deep. Ceramic finds bear a close resemblance to those recovered during previous excavations on the site, and it is anticipated that further analysis will indicate an early-middle Iron Age date for many of the excavated features.     Flintwork recovered from the subsoil in many trenches indicate background earlier prehistoric activity, most likely during the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic, while a possible ditch in the south-west corner of the site could date from the Roman period.     </value>

The central grid reference for the site was TQ 40452 85153. The fieldwork was undertaken between 27th and 30th January 2020. Four evaluation trenches were excavated. The earliest deposits encountered on site were Pleistocene gravels overlain by brickearth. Levels taken on the natural deposits indicated that the natural topography had a slight slope to the south. A total of six dedicated geo-archaeological test-pits were excavated all of which revealed Pleistocene deposits. A small quantity of derived struck flints was also recovered, the majority coming from the disturbed upper surface of the Pleistocene deposits. Five of the lithics could be securely dated, to the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic period. Other than the struck flints, no archaeological evidence dating to before the 19th century was recovered from the site. Evidence of a possible field boundary and agricultural soil could relate to the open nature of the site before its development in 1855. Layers of made ground and remnant tarmac surfaces indicated that the site had been developed for car parking during the 20th century.</value>

This was carried out on behalf of Caroline Rankine of Breathe Architects for their client  Eurofresh (Evesham) Ltd who intend the construction of a distribution warehouse with  integrated offices, a service yard and associated staff and visitor parking. A planning  application was submitted to Wychavon District Council (ref. W/11/1281) and approved  subject to conditions including a programme of archaeological works.  An archaeological evaluation undertaken 1988 in advance of the industrial estate uncovered a  scatter of lithic (flint) artefacts dating from the Mesolithic period (HER ref WSM45701) on  the south side of the proposed development site. The development was considered by the  Curator to have the potential to affect this archaeological site.  The scope of required works was outlined in a Brief prepared by requiring a programme of  fieldwalking followed by watching brief on groundworks associated with construction.  The footprint of the proposed development, measuring 100m x 50m was cleared of scrub,  ploughed, harrowed and left to weather before fieldwalking was undertaken. The area was  divided into 5mx5m grid squares and systematically walked in lines and artefactual material  was retrieved and placed in labelled bags.  The assemblage collected provided no evidence of activity earlier than the post-medieval  period. Accordingly the curator decided that a second stage of watching brief of groundworks  associated with construction would not be necessary.</value>

This comprised of  fourteen evaluation trial trenches, eight excavation trenches, a survey of extant earthworks, and the  auger survey of a pond. The project was commissioned by RPS (previously CgMs) on behalf of Crest  Nicholson, in advance of a proposed residential development.  An assemblage of Mesolithic flint was recovered from a tree throw in the eastern part of the site. This  was dominated by small blade debitage, and tools suggesting that flintknapping was carried out there  indicating the presence of a small temporary shelter, probably using the natural cover of a fallen tree.  Mesolithic flint was also recovered from another pit and potential activity of this period was noted  previously from a site to the east.  Evidence of medieval activity was fairly limited in most of the trenches, although one area of more  intensive activity was identified in the south-western part of the site. The activity largely dated to the  13th to early 14th century, and comprised of what appeared to be a pond, several other discrete  features including a possible well, a short ditch, as well as an undated fence line. All the features were  located to the west of a medieval ditch, which probably marks the boundary of an enclosure that was  partially exposed during the works.  The two surveys recorded the surviving features, and analysis of lidar data supplemented these  results. Most of the features surveyed were probably post-medieval field boundaries although a small  number may have their origins in the medieval period. The evaluation and excavation trenches  revealed limited archaeological evidence from the surveyed features, although many of the  earthworks were associated with features cutting the natural strata. Generally, however, these  features were sterile.</value>

In order to install the pontoon, the existing rock armour that limits erosion will be removed and four piles will be put installed, utilising a spud-legged crane barge. The rock armour will then be reinstated and inspected by divers to ensure adequate replacement. The Search Area comprises a 1 km buffer around the Brownsea Island proposed pontoon location (or Site) while the Study Area comprises a 50 m buffer around the site. Within the Search Area there are the following features: 13 Grade ll Listed Buildings; seven recorded wrecks in the Dorset Historic Environment Record and National Record of the Historic Environment databases; an anchorage; one submerged findspot and one terrestrial findspot; and potential for buried remains of seabed prehistory dating from the Palaeolithic to the Mesolithic and shipwrecks dating from the Neolithic to modern period. The assessment concludes that, although there is potential for archaeological deposits to be located within the Site, current design proposals indicate that the limited scale of development will have minimal impact.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological excavation was carried out on land adjacent to Easton Primary School, The Street, Easton, Suffolk, in advance of residential development.    A large assemblage of residual Mesolithic-Early Neolithic struck flint was found in deposits across the site.  It includes high proportions of primary working and core reduction waste, indicating that the glacial deposits on and around the site were intensively and repeatedly exploited as a source of good-quality knapping flint, perhaps particularly during the Late Mesolithic period (c. 6500-4000 BC).       The earliest datable features were two Early Bronze Age (c. 2200-1700 BC) pits.  One contained approximately half of a Beaker vessel, possibly deposited as a grave good accompanying a 'lost' crouched burial.  The second, smaller, pit contained cremated bone from an adult, radiocarbon-dated to 1879-1665 cal. BC at 95% confidence, together with fragments of perhaps four faience beads and pieces of a copper alloy object which had also been burnt on the pyre.  By the later Bronze Age, the landscape had been subdivided into a field system; Early Iron Age (c. 800-600 BC) occupation within the field system was evident from large quantities of pottery in some deposits and from two possible roundhouses.  Activity probably shifted away from the site by the Middle Iron Age but there was still a settlement in the near vicinity in the Middle and Late Iron Age (c. 400 BC-AD 50).  The occupation, which spanned the Roman Conquest, continued and expanded during the Romano-British period, when the site seems to have been on the edge of a farmstead located further up the hill to the north-west.  A set of boundary ditches divided this settlement area from agricultural land downslope to the south.  Two areas of finds-rich buried soil indicate dumping of domestic rubbish at the edge of the Roman settlement.  The settlement lasted until at least the end of the 4th century AD.   </value>

The works, a condition of planning permission being granted by Eastleigh Borough Council (Planning Reference O/13/73707 and R/14/75539) totalled 1.3 ha. Comprising two large areas (Areas 1 and 2), and seven smaller areas (Areas 3-9) approximately 20 x 20 m, they were subject to strip map and record excavation. A watching brief was also maintained during access road and swale groundworks.     A subcircular feature of unknown function contained a Mesolithic tranchet axe (c. 8500-4000 BC) and fragments of charred hazelnut shells. Further Mesolithic flints were recovered from the subsoil, and residually from later features.    A group of three Middle Bronze Age cremation graves containing urned burials, of which two were radiocarbon dated to 1620-1300 cal. BC. All three urns were inverted and damaged by ploughing, but well preserved. A small pit contained three sherds of possibly Middle Bronze Age pottery along with three pieces of struck flint and burnt flint. Further late prehistoric sherds were also found residually in other features.     A long curving gully pre-dates a Romano-British ditch and may also be of later prehistoric date. Late Iron Age/early Romano-British pottery and Romano-British tile were recovered from a small number of features in Area 1, including two ditches possibly forming part of a small Romano-British enclosure with a group of intercutting pits.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Evidence for transient prehistoric activity was limited to residual struck and burnt flint dated to the Mesolithic/Early Neolithic and Later Prehistory. Residual pottery indicates Roman and Saxon presence in the vicinity, although no features dating to these periods were encountered within the site.  The medieval occupation of the site can be characterised as 'edge of rural settlement', comprising pits and parts of a field system. The fields were aligned to the route of the old Holt road, as shown on Faden's map of 1797. Medieval activity within the site reached its peak in the early medieval period (11th-13th century) and diminished in the late medieval/early post-medieval period (13th-early 16th century). Although no structures dating to the medieval period were identified, the amount of pitting containing domestic waste and the presence of two small ovens suggests that there were dwellings alongside the road at this time.  Three post-medieval buildings that once stood by the side of the old Holt road were investigated, one of which is shown on Faden's map of 1797. The buildings were timber-built and one was partly built on a low coarse rubble wall.  The last phase, between 1802 and 1885, is associated with the realignment of the old Holt road to its current position and the formation of the current field system. This consisted of the demolition of the buildings alongside the old road, the infilling of the hollow formed by traffic along the old road and the removal of the remaining field and plot boundaries.   </value>

Eighteen archaeologically supervised trenches were excavated within the proposed development area.   The evaluation revealed evidence of settlement activity at the southern extent of the site. Six pits/tree throws dating to the Mesolithic-Early Neolithic that contained assemblage's of worked flint were identified in Trench 13, and six pits dating to the Early Iron Age (EIA) that contained assemblages of pottery were identified in Trench 12.  The two ditches identified in Trench 13 that are likely to be Neolithic-Bronze Age or EIA in date along with the features identified in Trenches 7 and 10 that date to the EIA are likely to be located on the periphery of the settlement activity. A large post-medieval extraction pit identified as an extant hollow and noted in Trenches 2, 5, 6, 11, 14, 15, 16 and 18 has truncated a large portion of the northern and eastern parts of the site. The post-medieval features identified in Trenches 1-3 likely relate to subdivision of the field during this time, whilst the modern features identified in Trench 17 likely relate to buildings located either to the north or east of the development site.</value>

The investigation is part of a programme of ongoing investigations associated with the Poole Harbour Habitat Creation Project.  The evaluation provides results refine the understanding of the presence, nature and distribution of Quaternary superficial deposits, palaeoenvironmental sequences and archaeological features across the development area.  It was confirmed that the base of the peat formed during the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, highlighting the potential for early archaeological remains. Indeed, a single flake of Portland Chert of Mesolithic/Neolithic date suggests a background of early activity, despite a lack of features dating earlier than the Iron Age.  A ditch indicating a possible trackway containing exclusively late Iron Age pottery was recorded in the north-eastern corner of the Moors. Late Iron Age/Romano-British ring gullies, ditches and pits comprised the majority of recorded features with concentrations in the western half of the scheme (Fields 5 and 7) and on high ground in the north-east (Field 19). The pottery assemblage recovered is indicative of activity from the Late Iron Age extending up until the late 2nd or early 3rd century.   Post medieval field ditches, drainage ditches and sea-wall earthwork were also revealed, with the majority correlating to boundaries depicted on historic mapping.   Peat cutting activity was also observed across the low lying area of the moors, though no dates for this activity are currently available, OSL samples have been taken. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Wessex Archaeology was commissioned by PMSS to undertake a Stage 3 archaeological assessment of samples taken from vibrocore VC7, recovered during a programme of geotechnical investigations on the proposed Project NEMO, UK-Belgium Electrical Interconnector.   The vibrocore was located c.12km east of Ramsgate on the margins of a palaeochannel feature visible on geophysical data. The vibrocore was chosen for Stage 3 assessment as it contained probable prehistoric terrestrial deposits with potential to provide information on the nature of past environments.    The results show successive environments including an early Holocene freshwater channel and freshwater pool within a wooded river valley that became progressively choked with vegetation. This woodland comprised pine and hazel with a possible highly significant record of beech. The increasing amounts of vegetation lead to peat formation, with radiocarbon dates indicating that this terrestrial environment dates from c.10,000 years ago, equivalent to the early Mesolithic period. Potential evidence of human activity in the form of charcoal has been recovered from the sediments. The well preserved remains of pollen, ostracods, molluscs and foraminifera are considered to be highly significant in the understanding of this early Mesolithic environment. This peat deposit has been truncated by sea level rise with subsequent deposition evident of possibly late Mesolithic date within outer estuarine and shallow marine environments.  It is recommended that further Stage 4 analysis work on the molluscs, ostracods and pollen is undertaken. This should be supported by further radiocarbon dating of the sediments to discover the timing of deposition of significant sediments.  </value>

The vibrocore underwent Stage 4 analysis at the request of English Heritage as it had the potential to provide palaeoenvironmental information that would significantly add to the archaeological record. The Stage 4 analysis involved the full analysis of the sediments for remains including pollen, microcharcoal, molluscs and ostracods. The results of the Stage 4 palaeoenvironmental analyses show successive environments including an early Holocene freshwater channel and freshwater pool within a wooded river valley that has become progressively vegetated. This Boreal woodland comprised predominantly pine and hazel typical of the Early Mesolithic period. The increasing amounts of vegetation led to peat formation, with two radiocarbon dates from the peat indicating that it dates to the early Mesolithic, c.10,000 years ago. The well preserved remains of pollen, ostracods, molluscs and foraminifera are considered to be highly significant in the understanding of this early Mesolithic environment. This peat deposit has been truncated by sea level rise with subsequent deposition evident of outer estuarine and shallow marine environments in the late Mesolithic period. The unique offshore location of this detailed sequence of deposits, from a previously unknown palaeovalley, make this analysis of great interest.  </value>

The archaeological works comprised two open area excavations at Orchard  Park East (OPE) and Orchard Park West (OPW), designated COP17, and a subsequent  watching brief. The watching brief comprised the monitoring of the excavation of the  drainage ditch corridor between Dunswell Road and North Moor Lane, designated COP18.  The OPE site targeted a 12th to 13th-century post-mill identified during the trial trenching  phase of works of the area, undertaken by ASWYAS in 2017. Little of the mound deposit  remained, although the broad windmill ditch was encountered, which formed two opposing  C-shape segments with causeways at the east-northeast and west-southwest sides. An  additional outer ring ditch associated with the post-mill structure was identified during the  excavations. The cross-trees of the post-mill and their associated foundation cut was not  observed suggesting that the cross-trees may have been positioned not at the base of the  mound but higher up within the clay deposit, similar to the findings at Little Bentley and  Great Bentley, Essex. The OPW site targeted a post-hole and linear feature which contained a Late  Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flint blade.

It was  commissioned by Orion Heritage Ltd on behalf of their client, Bloor Homes Western, in advance of  a consented residential development.  The excavation centred on a small spread of burnt stones and charcoal that was interpreted as  being part of a possible prehistoric burnt mound, which had been discovered during initial  archaeological evaluation of the site. It revealed more of a burnt stone and charcoal soil layer  alongside a series of cut features - pits and post/stakeholes - in the immediate surrounds, which  were considered to be associated with this layer. The group of features is typical of those often  encountered at a prehistoric burnt mound. As is common, the limited finds and environmental  assemblage did not elucidate or validate any of the hypotheses for the use of such sites.  Of particular interest in this instance, however, a programme of scientific dating produced early  Neolithic to early Bronze Age dates which suggested an unusually early and/or long-lived site  perhaps not directly comparable to the conventional middle to late Bronze Age examples of burnt  mounds. Flint pieces indicative of a Mesolithic or early Neolithic date and the environmental  remains (which included lime wood charcoal) also lent support to the dating of the features.  Overall, the dating and character of the remains would appear to be part of a long-lived burnt  mound that has origins in the earlier Neolithic, potentially being amongst the earliest examples  from England as a whole. It is clearly at the earlier end of the date range for those identified in the  Thames Valley (at places such as Yarnton) and across the midlands.

Mound 1 is very amorphous in shape and has been subject to historic quarrying. Investigation in the 19th century concluded that it had been entirely disturbed, but noted that quarrymen had found 80 later Roman brass coins at the site. Two trenches were excavated across the mound, recovering 12 further brass coins, late Mesolithic to Neolithic flints, and a few sherds of Bronze Age to Iron Age and Roman pottery. Where apparently undisturbed, the mound was formed of stone fragments in a soil matrix, and it was not possible to establish whether this was quarry spoil or a deliberate mound. Mound 2 proved to be a natural limestone outcrop, but further flints were found in the soil accumulated over it. Although it was not possible to establish whether mound 1 was a barrow, the artefactual evidence suggests that it has been treated as a significant place throughout the Mesolithic to Roman periods. This activity has included the manufacture of flint bladelets, and probable ritual deposition of pottery and coins.

<value columnNumber="1">The earliest activity on site related to residual finds of struck flints that were in majority recovered from the topsoil. This evidence indicates human activity on the site during the Mesolithic to Early Neolithic and Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age periods.  The primary result of the evaluation was the identification of a Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age field system formed by a series of NNE-SSW and ENE-WSW aligned ditches. The field system represented a continuation of the activity identified immediately north of the site, in an excavation conducted by ASE in 2014.Typically for landscape divisions from this period, artefactual evidence was limited to only a few sherds of very abraded pottery. The site provides an important addition to the growing, yet still sparse, evidence for Bronze Age field systems in Suffolk. Two pits and a possible posthole belonging to this period were also identified, however their exact function is difficult to ascertain.    The evaluation also identified a possible Prehistoric or Roman small enclosure ditch in Trench 57, the exact function of which is difficult to ascertain.  The evaluation confirmed the presence of post-medieval boundary ditches shown on the 1886 OS Map. In addition, two post-medieval pits were also identified in Trenches 49 and 53.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological watching brief was undertaken by AOC Archaeology during the excavation of the basement in the north western corner of the site.  The natural geology observed was London Clay found at heights between 11.50m OD and 11.00m. The stratigraphic deposit sequence recorded within the excavation area showed London Clay overlain by silty clay subsoil, then made ground deposits sealed by concrete.   Two archaeological features were identified and recorded. A single ditch was found in the southern part of the excavated area and is interpreted as a drainage ditch, due to the sites proximity to the River Wandle and the local history of riverside industry. The single deposit is suggestive of infill from the surrounding natural soil and brick fragments found in the fill may be part of a drain or culvert (since destroyed by post-medieval industrial activity) that helped facilitate this purpose. The finds retrieved do not provide a firm date, although it is suggested that overall, the assemblage points to a post-medieval date. Earlier finds are suggested as representing low levels of human activity in the vicinity since the late Mesolithic period. A later post-medieval pit was also found truncating the ditch and is of 19th to 20th century date.  Finds recovered include lithics, Roman pottery fragments, post-medieval pottery, CBM (Ceramic Building Material), glass, industrial residues, plant remains and animal bone fragments.  </value>

Work targeted deep Late Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic floodplain and wetland edge archaeology and associated sedimentary sequences. The key aims were to contribute, in conjunction with a number of other Historic England projects, towards the further advancement and implementation of the National Heritage Protection Plan for wetland regions throughout England generally; to raise awareness of the finite and significant Late Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic archaeology of the Middle Kennet Valley specifically; and to provide guidance to West Berkshire Council in identifying appropriate mitigation measures in response to development proposals. In fulfilment of these aims, the project produced a comprehensive database of all known Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic archaeology, lithology and palaeoenvironmental data in the Study Area, and a general predictive sedimentary model arising from that database.

<value columnNumber="1">A Mesolithic flint assemblage probably represents an episode of occupation on the bank of the River Dene with high potential of the site for future research.  Small amounts of Romano-British, late Saxon and Saxo-Norman pottery probably indicate settlement. Domesday records the village of Walton as a valuable settlement containing three mills and it appears that the site contains part of this settlement. An alluvial event probably impacted the site around the Saxo-Norman period.  The pottery assemblage revealed that the largest number of dateable features are from the 12th/13th centuries. These include hot activities evidenced by heat-transformed deposits and the remains of a structure, perhaps kilns, crop dryers, ovens or furnaces, and enclosed by a gully. A metalled trackway (312) from the same period was also used as a boundary that persisted until at least the 15th century. Another boundary delineated by up to six iterations of ditches and gullies, some dating to the 12th/13th centuries, may also be significant.  The 13th/14th centuries saw the establishment of a probable enclosure. A 12th/13th-century structure evidenced by a posthole (357) was rebuilt in stone in the 15th/16th centuries (building 361).  The environmental evidence was consistent with crop processing and domestic waste, and suggests this may be an important site for the study of human activity in the Midlands. Aspects of the pottery assemblage are informative of regional trading networks. The recovery of small animal and fish bones demonstrate that site conditions are favourable for the preservation of a range of remains.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In October 2017, ARCA undertook a geoarchaeological borehole investigation at Faberlux Yard, Lower Brook Street, Winchester on behalf of Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd.  Two boreholes revealed the presence of the Lewis Nodular Chalk Formation between 28.72m OD and 28.86m OD. The Chalk was overlain by late Pleistocene marly deposits and fluvial sands and gravels (River Terrace Deposits 1). These were succeeded by fluvio-paludal deposits consisting of interbedded peats and tufas.  A basal peat dates to 7935-7604 cal BC (Early Mesolithic). Pollen  pointed to cold climatic conditions dominated by pine woodland and hazel scrub with sedges and grasses, although there was some evidence for deciduous woodland and warmer conditions. A large molluscan assemblage from the overlying tufa reiterated the lithological evidence for the presence of shallow chalk streams and vegetated backwaters coeval with the sedge fen.  A top peat dated to the Roman/Anglo Saxon period, and pollen revealed an open environment with evidence of human disturbance. An influx of floodplain fines overwhelmed the fluvio-paludal deposits and, in conjunction with human activity, grey diamicts between 2.60m and 3.05m thick were formed. Between 0.30m and 0.75m of modern Made Ground completed the sequence.  </value>

Prehistoric finds of flint may be as ancient as the Mesolithic period but are probably residual in later features. There are several features which contain flint flakes as their only finds, so these could represent use of the land in the Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age. The Romano-British period, from the 2nd to 4th centuries AD, is represented by two 'robbed out' foundation trenches and over 112 pieces of pottery from Trench 7, a burned pit with cremated pig remains and field boundaries with occasional finds. Roman settlement activity is concentrated around Trench 7, the highest point topographically of the Site. There is also a concentration of finds and features of 10th-13th century date on Site in the northeast corner of the north field, close to Manor Farm and the village of Launton. The finds are from ditches which could represent property boundaries of medieval date. A substantial visible earthwork crosses the Site from southeast to northeast. The date of its establishment and the reason for its presence has not been proved in this evaluation, save for it is later than the Roman period and earlier than the 16th century. It could be a drainage ditch but has very high embankments. A potential hollow way or boundary is visible on LiDAR data in the location of the earthwork so therefore may represent this. It continues beyond the Site, and its origins may be addressed as a research question in the event of further Site investigations</value>

The assessment was commissioned by Mr. Graham McCormick of Scott Properties in support of a planning application for the first phase of development of the site building 200 dwellings of 1400 proposed dwellings.    In the past a scattering of multi-period finds from the Mesolithic onwards and inclusive, but mainly dating to the medieval and post-medieval periods, including pottery and coins, have been found within the site.  The site also contains cropmarks identified from aerial photography, some of which relate to a denser concentration of cropmarks immediately to the north of the site, which are mainly attributed to the Iron Age and medieval periods. In particular three or four NE-SW aligned cropmarks crossing the site may relate to Iron Age land divisions. There are two known archaeological sites on the Breck Farm site, the foundations of a probable a barn (NHER 7910), and the abandoned line of the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line (NHER 13584).    The site is largely undisturbed and therefore has a high potential for archaeological remains particularly relating to the Iron Age, medieval and post-medieval periods.      In the wider area surrounding the proposed development site are a number of designated and non-designated heritage assets, including locally listed buildings, statutory listed buildings, and scheduled monuments. Due to a combination of factors including distance, topography, arboreal growth, and previous modern development, the proposed development will only have a negligible impact on the settings of the heritage assets in the surrounding area.  </value>

The trial trenching confirmed the presence of an enclosed Roman settlement at Field Farm that pottery evidence suggested dated to the late 2nd century to 4th century AD. A single kiln was identified and CBM suggested structural remains. Finds from the site included worked flint of late Mesolithic, Neolithic to early Bronze Age dates found largely in the topsoil or subsoil on the site or within later features; Iron Age, Roman and early medieval pottery and other finds, and post-medieval pottery, in addition to ceramic building material and animal bone. Curvilinear ditches may relate to two Iron Age dwellings. Burnt bone and c400 iron nails were recovered from the single Roman cremation identified. The most significant finds also included two Roman armlets - one in shale and one in copper alloy - and an early medieval bead. A 4th century AD coin was recovered from subsoil.

The evaluation provides results refine the understanding of the presence, nature and distribution of Quaternary superficial deposits, palaeoenvironmental sequences and archaeological features across the development area.  It was confirmed that the base of the peat formed during the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, highlighting the potential for early archaeological remains. Indeed, a single flake of Portland Chert of Mesolithic/Neolithic date suggests a background of early activity, despite a lack of features dating earlier than the Iron Age.  A ditch indicating a possible trackway containing exclusively late Iron Age pottery was recorded in the north-eastern corner of the Moors. Late Iron Age/Romano-British ring gullies, ditches and pits comprised the majority of recorded features with concentrations in the western half of the scheme (Fields 5 and 7) and on high ground in the north-east (Field 19). The pottery assemblage recovered is indicative of activity from the Late Iron Age extending up until the late 2nd or early 3rd century.

Cartographic evidence suggests that the Site was located within agricultural fields or unoccupied land from at least the late medieval period. However, it is likely that the Site was undeveloped and used for agriculture since the late Saxon period.  This investigation identified a low to medium potential for medium to high significance Prehistoric remains, a low potential for medium to high significance Roman occupation remains, a low potential for post Roman low to medium significance occupation remains, and high potential for low significance agricultural remains dating from the Saxon to the modern periods within the proposed area of development.  </value>

The site lies between 1.1m and 1.8m above Ordnance Datum (AOD) and the National Grid Reference for the centre of the site is 548164 182885.    The report summarises the geoarchaeological potential of the sediments revealed in 3 geoarchaeological window samples taken across the site. By modelling the buried stratigraphy and preliminarily reconstructing the evolving landscape of the site, three facies of varying archaeological and palaeoenvironmental potential are identified and recommendations regarding further work are proposed.    The site is situated at the centre of the River Thames floodplain. The underlying deposits of archaeological interest consist of Pleistocene floodplain gravels. The floodplain gravels were found to be overlain by a 3.70m layer of Holocene floodplain deposits comprising sandy/silty clay alluvium interspersed with bands of peat. Across the site, the Holocene deposits are sealed by an average of 3m of made ground.

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological watching brief was undertaken by CFA at Tralorg Wind Farm during construction, which included the controlled dismantling of a group of eight turf-banked structures (Site 45a-h). Four of these, (Site 45a-d) had been previously investigated by hand excavation. All were shown to be turf-banked with limited information on function and date. A possible fired clay floor surface, a small pit and a possible fire pit were the only features noted. No finds were recovered during the watching brief.    On the basis of morphology and other excavated examples, these structures were expected to date anywhere from the Early Historic to the Post-Medieval periods. However, the secure dating of upland turf-banked structures is problematic, often due to the lack of associated finds and secure deposits containing material suitable for radiocarbon dating. As a consequence, WoSAS required some radiocarbon dating for these structures and a programme of post-excavation analysis was undertaken which has shed further light on the findings of the watching brief.     Carbonised plant remains recovered from the turf bank of structure 45e comprise potential evidence for agricultural activity occurring nearby and possibly cereal drying or cooking. Radiocarbon dates of the mid-15th and mid 17th centuries. indicate that the site may represent a small late Medieval to early Post-Medieval agricultural settlement. However, charred material contained within bank material is not taphonomically secure and so provides a terminus post quem. While it is possible that this material derives from activity taking place within the structure or from midden material, these dates should be used with caution until a larger body of dates for these types of structures has been obtained.    The burning activity noted within the small gully beneath structure 45e dates to the Mesolithic period and so cannot be related to the use of the structures.</value>

The heritage assets recorded within the 1km assessment area and cartographic evidence dating from the post medieval period suggests that the proposed area of development was located away from the foci of settlement during the Roman and post Roman periods being located within open fields from at least the medieval period onwards, or probably earlier. This history of landuse has probably resulted in low intensity archaeological remains associated with agricultural activity.    This study identified a significant potential for archaeological buried remains within the proposed area of development. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">In May and June 2020, Cotswold Archaeology carried out an  archaeological evaluation of land adjacent to the A47 at Wansford,  Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. A total of 116 trenches were  excavated. Archaeological remains were identified across the site,  primarily as infilled ditches and small to medium sized pits. These  mainly represented evidence for agricultural activities in the form  of ditches, gullies and pits, of low-level settlement and localised  industrial activity.  The phases of activity identified within the site can be summarised  as follows: Mesolithic or early Neolithic low intensity activity was  concentrated in Priority Area 1, with isolated finds recovered in  Priority Area 4 as well; sparse evidence of Late Prehistoric  occupation was found in the western field of Priority Area 4;  evidence of low-level activity in the Roman period was found in  Priority Areas 1, 3, and 4, with more evident 1st - 2nd century AD  settlement activity recorded in Priority Area 1. The large quarry pits  in Priority Area 3 may be dated to the Roman period as well, though  could be of later origin. After a possible hiatus in the mid to late  Roman period, activity within the site resumed in the early medieval  period. This comprised 5th to 6th century AD material mainly  concentrated in Priority Area 3. The SFB in Trench 91 and the  possible SFB in Trench 92 belong to this phase. The undated  inhumation burials and disturbed neonate remains in Priority Area  4 may be of Roman or early medieval origin too, though this needs  further investigation to confirm. Evidence for medieval and postmedieval  activity, aside from agricultural activity, was mostly  concentrated in Priority Area 4, possibly in connection with gravel  extraction activities.</value>

Out of 465 trenches, 128 contained archaeological features. The trial trenching confirmed the presence of an enclosed Roman settlement at Field Farm that pottery evidence suggested dated to the late 2nd century to 4th century AD. A single kiln was identified and CBM suggested structural remains. Finds from the site included worked flint of late Mesolithic, Neolithic to early Bronze Age dates found largely in the topsoil or subsoil on the site or within later features; Iron Age, Roman and early medieval pottery and other finds, and post-medieval pottery, in addition to ceramic building material and animal bone. Curvilinear ditches may relate to two Iron Age dwellings. Burnt bone and c400 iron nails were recovered from the single Roman cremation identified. The most significant finds also included two Roman armlets - one in shale and one in copper alloy - and an early medieval bead. A 4th century AD coin was recovered from subsoil. At Paradise Farm, a small Iron Age settlement with possible enclosure and ring ditch was identified. Worked flints of Neolithic-Bronze Age date included part of a polished axe and a tanged arrowhead.

The evaluation consisted of seven trenches, excavated within the proposed development area for residential dwellings together with associated open space, landscaping, highway and drainage infrastructure works.   A total of five natural periglacial hollows were identified across the site. These natural features produced a small number of worked flints, dating from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic periods, and a single sherd of Early Bronze Age Beaker pottery. The only other features of note were a ditch, that probably formed part of an early post-medieval field system, and a modern refuse pit.

All of the archaeological deposits and features revealed were then manually excavated and recorded.    The earliest evidence of activity at the site consisted of a background scatter of flintwork and a shallow spread, both of Mesolithic date. Neolithic flintwork (including an unfinished arrowhead) demonstrated continuing exploitation of the resources of this part of the Weald. but the first clear alterations to the landscape dated from the Middle Iron Age. Pits containing burnt clay and clusters of post-holes suggest sedentary occupation than in previous periods.     However, arguably the most interesting and enigmatic features encountered at the site consisted of a thin scatter of remarkably similar pits/hearths showing evidence of in situ burning and primary fills consisting almost entirely of charcoal. These somewhat enigmatic features were spread across both examined mitigation area. Limited pottery finds and a C14 date suggest a date range from the Late Iron Age into the Romano-British era, although their function remains unclear.    Evidence for medieval activity consisted of abraded pottery recovered from the overburden, and possibly in the form field boundaries close to Isaacs Lane, although their date remains unproven. Post-medieval activity was more clearly represented in a varied assemblage of artefacts from the topsoil, suggesting military activity in the area, and clear land division in the form of substantial ditches corresponding to field boundaries shown in cartographic sources.  </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between July and December 2017, Oxford Archaeology East undertook excavation of an area of c.5ha east of New Road, Melbourn.  A series of natural hollows were found across the site, producing Mesolithic and Neolithic flintwork and Neolithic pottery as well as small quantities of faunal and human skeletal remains.   Middle Neolithic activity was suggested by the presence of Peterborough Ware pottery from several features. Increased human activity was evidenced in the Late Neolithic by fourteen pits which produced significant assemblages of faunal remains, Grooved Ware pottery and struck flints, alongside charred hazelnut shells and cereal grains and a few fragments of shell.   Early Bronze Age ritual/funerary features were also uncovered. A cremation burial deposited in a pit, dated to c.2140-1950 cal BC, was located close to the main area of Late Neolithic activity. Two ditched round barrows were also excavated. One, single ditched, was poor in finds and produced no burials or other evidence for funerary activity. The second was double ditched and surrounded the grave of a Beaker-type inhumation burial of a single juvenile, dated to c.1920-1740 cal BC and buried with a plano-convex flint knife.  Settlement activity continued through Middle Bronze Age. The settlement comprised up to 15 post-built structures, most of roundhouse form, associated with two distinct forms of enclosure. There were also three wells belonging to this period.  A Middle Saxon enclosure ditch, partially re-worked and cut through by a well, lay in the north of the site.  Several beam-slot features, possibly of medieval date, were also revealed. Some of which may be associated with the post-medieval line of Ashwell Street.   Ashwell Street, in its post-medieval form, crossed the site and intersected with 18th century tracks. All these route ways were represented by road-side ditches associated with extensive wheel ruts.</value>

Area 1 occupied occupied a ridge overlooking the tributary of the Finham Brook and contained boundary ditches, cremated human remains and a hearth all probably of Romano British date. Area 2 lay to the southeast of the A429 and contained further boundary ditches with pottery of Late Bronze Age to Middle Iron Age date, set against a potential backdrop of prehistoric flintworking dated to the Neolithic or Bronze Age. Isolated features found elsewhere included probable post medieval and modern boundary or drainage ditches and hedgerows and undated pits.    The earliest dateable evidence from the trial trenching was 12 pieces of worked stone indicative of sporadic prehistoric activity (note: mitigation excavation later revealed a regionally significant Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic camp). The modest finds assemblage consists mostly of pottery with smaller quantities of other materials including cremated human bone. Soil samples were generally uninformative.

The archaeological remains encountered during the excavation represented a period of human and environmental activity from the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic to the late Iron Age.     Geologically the excavation area was underlain by Alluvium associated with the river Thames noted at -3.10m OD. This was overlain by a 2.4m of peat formation which in turn was overlain by alluvium.   Fragments of struct and burnt flint, recovered from the lower alluvium represented the human activity in the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic. Worked timbers with tool cuts recovered from the upper peat formation indicated a period of activity from the Bronze Age.   A series of late Iron Age ditches, pits and postholes that cut into the upper alluvial deposit were the latest evidence of human activity noted on site.    Modern deposits directly sealed the archaeological remains and represented the current ground level.

Six pits/tree throws dating to the Mesolithic-Early Neolithic that contained assemblage's of worked flint were identified in Trench 13, and six pits dating to the Early Iron Age (EIA) that contained assemblages of pottery were identified in Trench 12.  The two ditches identified in Trench 13 that are likely to be Neolithic-Bronze Age or EIA in date along with the features identified in Trenches 7 and 10 that date to the EIA are likely to be located on the periphery of the settlement activity.

The works, comprising 127 trial trenches and four excavation areas (totalling 5300 m2), were carried out between 15 April and 7 August 2019.  The investigations produced a small assemblage of potentially Late Palaeolithic/Mesolithic and Neolithic-Bronze Age worked flint, predominantly from undated colluvial deposits (sporadically underlain by layers of burnt wood/charcoal) within trenches in the western part of the pipeline route.   Several incomplete and overlapping ring gullies in the central part of the route  formed part of a Late Iron Age-Early Romano-British settlement, possibly surrounded by enclosure ditches. A small pit contained the fragmentary remains of an unusual fired-clay object or structure - perhaps a portable oven. A few sherds of earlier Iron Age pottery were also found residually here, but no features or deposits can be securely attributed to the same period.  Medieval pottery, mostly of 11th-13th century date, came from several ditches and pits in the area of the Late Iron Age-Early Romano-British settlement. Meanwhile, pottery of 13th-15th century date was retrieved from ditches, a layer of debris and other features in the excavation areas at the eastern end of the route.

Stripping of the site remained within the subsoil in some places, so that any underlying archaeological features would have been obscured. North of centre, the area marked out for the weighbridges and wheel wash was stripped to a greater depth which did allow for an examination for archaeological features.

Evidence for the Roman field system was concentrated in the northern part of the site, but a further Roman ditch on the same alignment near the southern boundary of the site in Area 1 suggests that the field system may have extended across the whole of the development area.

<value columnNumber="1">  A Community Archaeology project was organised by Archaeology South-East. This report provides the results of the fourth season of archaeological investigation of a 3.7ha field called Little Stiances, located at Sharpsbridge Lane, Newick, East Sussex. This work was carried out in June 2019.    Geophysical and topographic surveys carried out in 2010 confirmed the location of a 'lost' cottage known from cartographic sources and allowed the targeting of test-pits at that location in 2010, 2013 and 2016. Other target areas identified during those surveys, including house platforms and a sunken routeway, were investigated in 2013 and 2016. In 2019 test-pits were again located at the site of the cottage and garden, and on either site of the identified routeway.    Unfortunately work at the site was somewhat curtailed by poor weather, but as in previous years, the 'Cottage Site' produced a variety of finds reflecting the occupation of buildings in that part of the field, mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Finds ranged from elements of the fabric of the building to pottery, clay pipes and domestic items such as buttons.    Test-pits located to the west of the sunken routeway showed a marked concentration of medieval pottery, strongly suggesting the presence of medieval occupation fronting onto the sunken way leading from the road towards the cottage site. A platform to the east of the route, presumed to be the site of a building produced little material.    The recovery of  the usual background scatter of Mesolithic/Early Neolithic flintwork from the site highlights the use of the general area by Hunter/Gatherers, and continued to stretch the site's chronology back into prehistory.  </value>

The later prehistoric features comprised, part of a possible enclosure in the south-west of the site, shallow field ditches and many very shallow pits. Recovered pottery suggests a Middle-Late Bronze Age to Middle-Late Iron Age date. The Romano-British features consisted of occasional ditches and shallow pits, suggestive of a rural organised agricultural landscape. One structure recorded in the central area of the site is interpreted as a possible granary.   Medieval ditched enclosures contained more pottery and a 13th-14th century silver brooch and a silver coin from the reign of Charles I (AD 1625-1649). Likely related to the scheduled medieval settlement of West Leaze to the east these may indicate the shifting nature of the settlement.

Naturally formed periglacial hollows were found across the site containing Mesolithic struck flints and Early Neolithic flint and pottery, as well as animal bone and, in one case, disarticulated human skeletal remains.  Later Neolithic activity was confined to three possible Early-Middle Neolithic pits and 16 Late Neolithic pits associated with Grooved Ware pottery. The pits have been radiocarbon dated to broadly c.2900-2500calBC, although the elk antler itself, possibly curated, remains to be dated.  A single Early Bronze Age un-urned cremation burial and a slightly later inhumation burial were also located in the south-west of the site. The latter was surrounded by a double ring-ditch and probably capped by a barrow. A second, undated probable barrow lay in the north of the site.  A multi-phased Middle Bronze Age settlement and enclosure system dominated the eastern part of the site, comprising lines of postholes forming enclosures and paths, along with a ditched rectilinear enclosure. Three wells were dug across the east of the site. One of these contained a Middle Bronze Age pottery assemblage. There were up to 10 post-built roundhouse-type structures, as well as several other structural forms.   A post-Roman enclosure ditch with causeway, lying largely beyond the north of the site's limits, has been radiocarbon dated to the 7th-8th centuries AD (Early/Middle Saxon period).

The earliest remains comprised several pits and a ditch sealed by a  buried soil and colluvial layer. These produced a small assemblage  of Mesolithic flints. Clearer evidence for early settlement came from a number of  Neolithic pits scattered across much of the site. These produced a  range of finds, including Grooved ware and Peterborough ware  pottery. One large cut produced  a small assemblage of Beaker Period or Early Bronze Age pottery  but is of uncertain function.  The majority of the remains related to an enclosed roundhouse  settlement, dated by the presence of handmade pottery to the Early  to Middle Iron Age. Included within this were a rectilinear  enclosure, partially exposed within the site which contained two,  possibly three, roundhouses. The edge of a second possible  enclosure was also recorded, whilst other Iron Age remains  included a scatter of pits and postholes. There was no evidence for  a Late Iron Age presence, and Roman remains were restricted to a  few pits and ditches from which a small pottery assemblage  spanning the Roman period was recovered.  Later remains comprised up to 8 sunken-featured buildings (SFBs)  dated to the 5th to 8th/9th centuries AD. The SFBs also  contained assemblages of Roman finds, probably deliberately  curated for re-use, and there was a notable find of a boar canine  which had been pierced with a nail, probably for use as a talisman  or amulet. Groups of postholes suggest the possible presence of at  least three post-built early medieval halls associated with the SFBs,  although these were technically undated. Other early medieval  remains included ditched and fenced boundaries and a few pits  and postholes.  The remaining features on site were post-medieval or later in date  and included a few ditched boundaries, pits and quarry pits.</value>

<value columnNumber="1">archaeological evaluation by trial trenching carried out by Pre-Construct Archaeology between 4th and 12th January on Land off Greyhound Lane, Banham, Norfolk. The work was commissioned by The Land Group on behalf of Breckland Bridge Ltd., in advance of a residential development of 42 dwellings. The aim of the work was to define the location, date, extent, character, condition, and quality of any archaeological remains on the site, to assess the significance of any such remains in a local, regional, or national context, as appropriate, and to assess the potential impact of the development proposals on the site's archaeology.    The trial trenching revealed traces of the prehistoric activity in the form of worked flint, recovered from unstratified soil horizons as well as later features, manufactured using various knapping technologies, and spanning the course of the Mesolithic to the Iron Age periods. The activity on site during the Middle-Late Iron Age period was also revealed by a hand-made pottery sherd, discovered in a large pit, in the eastern part of the site.    The most significant finding was the discovery of a potential pond or a quarry pit, a well and two kiln/oven-like structures, with an abundant level of finds and building material, dated to the Middle-Late Roman period, indicating the presence of high-status building/s in the vicinity of the area. Another important discovery was a series of ditches, pits, and postholes, also dated to the Roman period, identified across a large portion of the site (11 trenches). These ditches were possibly acting as boundaries around the villa or a bath house.    The trial trenching at Banham also identified a long Post-medieval drainage ditch inked with the OS map from the year 1883.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1">An archaeological evaluation was conducted to mitigate the potential impact of a woodland creation scheme at Frankland Wood, County Durham. In particular, the work was undertaken to assess the possible presence of prehistoric lithics, given previous discoveries in the area. The plan was to accurately plot any concentrations of lithics discovered, subsequently leaving a clearing around them within the new woodland.     The methodology, developed specifically for this project, involved the investigation of lines of mounds created by an 'enviro-mounder' machine in advance of tree planting. Work consisted of a combination of visual inspection of all 7000 mounds, together with trowelling a sample of mounds.     The evaluation results suggest that no lithics survive in HER site D1043, which appears to be only an approximate location. The only lithics recorded were further to the south, beyond the proposed area. The few lithics recovered here closely resemble the assemblage recovered in the 1950s/60s, suggesting this could have been the focus of the original assemblage. Most of the finds are later-Mesolithic in date, suggesting the area had been occupied intermittently as a temporary campsite, potentially over a period of centuries, by groups of hunter-gatherers. It is certain that further lithics lie buried in the general location, and possible that associated settlement remains could also survive, but perhaps more likely that any such remains have now been destroyed by tree roots and ploughing.    The results reinforce the general impression of Mesolithic occupation in the Wear valley, demonstrating that such sites do still survive and could perhaps be subjected to future analysis. The low density of finds from disturbed contexts means that they present no significant archaeological constraint on the proposed woodland creation scheme. However, a case could be made for leaving the cluster of sites in Area 3 unplanted, perhaps with a 10-metre buffer.</value>

The investigation is part of a programme of ongoing investigations associated with the Poole Harbour Habitat Creation Project.  The evaluation provides results refine the understanding of the presence, nature and distribution of Quaternary superficial deposits, palaeoenvironmental sequences and archaeological features across the development area.  It was confirmed that the base of the peat formed during the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, highlighting the potential for early archaeological remains. Indeed, a single flake of Portland Chert of Mesolithic/Neolithic date suggests a background of early activity, despite a lack of features dating earlier than the Iron Age.  A ditch indicating a possible trackway containing exclusively late Iron Age pottery was recorded in the north-eastern corner of the Moors. Late Iron Age/Romano-British ring gullies, ditches and pits comprised the majority of recorded features with concentrations in the western half of the scheme (Fields 5 and 7) and on high ground in the north-east (Field 19). The pottery assemblage recovered is indicative of activity from the Late Iron Age extending up until the late 2nd or early 3rd century.   Post medieval field ditches, drainage ditches and sea-wall earthwork were also revealed, with the majority correlating to boundaries depicted on historic mapping.   Peat cutting activity was also observed across the low lying area of the moors, though no dates for this activity are currently available, OSL samples have been taken. </value>

<value columnNumber="1">Between January and March 2019, Archaeological Solutions Ltd (AS) conducted an archaeological excavation on land adjacent to Bears Lane, Lavenham, Suffolk. Based on the material evidence in addition to stratigraphic and spatial relationships between archaeological features, three phases of archaeological activity have been identified. No early prehistoric features were identified during the excavation, but an assemblage of Mesolithic to Early Neolithic struck flints were recovered. The first phase of activity on the site, though limited, comprised two isolated pits that both contained a single sherd of probable late Bronze Age to early Iron Age pottery (Phase 1).       Substantial activity occurred on the site during the 1st  to 2nd century AD (Phase 2.1). The archaeology encountered of this date comprised a ditch system that enclosed extensive and well-preserved evidence for late 1st to early 2nd century AD pottery production. Two Phase 2.1 pottery kilns, in addition to a further probable pottery kiln, and an oven were identified during the excavation. The kilns may reflect the domestic demand of a nearby occupation in Lavenham. In addition to evidence of pottery production, a series of pits and the skeleton of an adult male  were encountered.     Between the 2nd and 3rd century AD the intensity of activity within the excavation area appears to have decreased; however, the evidence suggests that more substantial occupation activity remains in situ to the east. </value>

Due to poor site conditions, with standing water and heavy snowfall, it was not possible to fully investigate the remains found in all the trenches, but the evaluation was successful in identifying and charactering archaeological remains dating from the Neolithic through to the post-medieval period.  An area of potentially Early Neolithic activity, represented by several small pits, was identified to the north-west of the development area. Further evidence for Late Mesolithic or Neolithic activity included a small quantity of struck and burnt flint recovered from natural deposits on the edge of the first river terrace in Area 6.   In Areas 1, 3, 4 and 5 a small number of ditches and pits associated with small quantities of finds of Iron Age and/or Romano-British date suggest the area was on the edge of settlement, with the ditches potentially representing field systems.  Area 6 contained a large number of post-medieval features, mostly associated with the Napoleonic camp and barracks formed at Weeley in the late 1700s/early 1800s. These included brick footings made from unfrogged hand-made bricks and potential building construction cuts. The possible remains of a camp kitchen were also identified. Several large extraction pits or cess pits were also identified. Finds dating to this period included several military buttons including one from the 11th Light Dragoons.

Permanent occupation began in the Early Iron Age, as shown by dense clusters of intercutting pits, more dispersed pitting, two shallow ditches and an inhumation.    A large, rectangular enclosure with a substantial V-shaped ditch, provisionally dated to the later Iron Age, might have been a livestock corral or a defensive feature.    Intensive use of the site during the Roman period was represented by sequences of superimposed and intercutting ditched enclosures, a possible trackway, areas of pitting, a corn-drying oven, a possible cellared building and a small inhumation cemetery. This evidence supplements that from an adjacent excavation (CHER: ECB3847), and it is likely that both areas were part of the same farming estate.    During the Early Anglo-Saxon period (5th-6th century AD), part of the site was used as an inhumation cemetery. Approximately 90 burials were found, many with grave goods, and some of the graves were richly furnished. This cemetery was discovered originally in the 19th century, on the opposite side of Fordham Road (CHER: 07027). Two urned cremations in the same area of the site might have been part of a separate phase of funerary activity.

Residual worked flint of Mesolithic to early Bronze Age date provides evidence for a transitory presence in the landscape at this time.    The majority of features, excavated in Area A, were indicative of middle - late Bronze Age (1500 - 900 BC) agricultural activity. A N/S row of postholes thought to constitute a fenced boundary and an E/W ditch are thought to represent the earliest, and only, instances of land division on site. Contemporary large pits are thought to relate to water storage/collection, whilst dispersed smaller pits provide further evidence for activity in the period. The predominately domestic nature of the pottery assemblage recovered from features assigned to the period is indicative of settlement activity in the vicinity, possibly beyond the sites western boundary.     Limited evidence for early Anglo-Saxon settlement was encountered on site, represented by a single Sunken-Feature Building (SFB) on the eastern boundary of Area A. Whilst the building appears to have existed in isolation, a fragmentary pottery assemblage was indicative of wider, probably dispersed, occupation in the vicinity during the 6th and 7th centuries in an agricultural landscape.

A number of prehistoric finds were recovered from the interface of the original land surface (itself colluvial in nature) which included struck flint, a fragment of lava rock and a single sherd of prehistoric pot. In total, six struck flint flakes were recovered which showed affinities with Late Mesolithic/early Neolithic technologies. One diagnostic piece placed it firmly into the Late Mesolithic.
