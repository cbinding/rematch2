The evaluation was commissioned by Pegasus Planning Group, acting on behalf of Haymaker Energy Ltd, and was carried out prior to the submission of a planning application for the construction of a solar park on the site. Evidence for Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age activity, comprising a pit and a ditch from which a small assemblage of pottery was recovered, was encountered on the south-east facing slope overlooking the valley of Silverstone Brook. In the same area the remains of a small Roman settlement, probably a farmstead and associated field system, were identified. The Roman features contained pottery, animal bone and fragments of Roman roof tile, the latter indicating that there may have been a building in the vicinity. The Middle/Late Saxon remains comprised a circular or oval enclosure, although no evidence was encountered for features within the enclosure. Pottery dateable to the 7th to 10th centuries, a fragment of an iron pin or bobbin and a metal fragment, possibly part of a bucket with mineralised wood fibres adhering to its surface, were recovered from the enclosure ditch. The archaeological features broadly corresponded with anomalies detected by a geophysical survey of the site, although in a number of instances there was only an approximate correlation with the geophysical survey results, possibly due to the highly variable geology. Many of the anomalies interpreted as being of possible archaeological significance were confirmed as geological in origin and several features were identified that were not detected by the geophysical survey.",

A single sherd of Anglo-Saxon grass-tempered pottery was also residual. The earliest features, which accounted for the majority of the remains on site, relate to medieval agricultural activity focused within a large enclosure. There was little to suggest domestic occupation within the site: the pottery assemblage was modest and well abraded, whilst charred plant remains were sparse, and, as with some metallurgical residues, point to waste disposal rather than the locations of processing or consumption. A focus of occupation within the Rodley Manor site, on higher ground 160m to the north-west, seems likely, with the currently site having lain beyond this and providing agricultural facilities, most likely corrals and pens for livestock. Animal bone was absent, but the damp, low-lying ground would have been best suited to cattle. An assemblage of medieval coins recovered from the subsoil during a metal detector survey may represent a dispersed hoard.",

The project involved routine diver survey of the HMS/M A1 and a site plan of the main elements of the wreck was produced supplemented by photographic and video recording. The impact of illegal diving activities on the wreck was assessed and recommendations were made for its future management. In addition, two geophysical anomalies located in proximity to the wreck were investigated to establish if they were associated with the wreck. The dataset comprises databases relating to the diver recording system(DIVA) and ROV-track diver tracking, GIS shapefiles for the diver tracklogs and photographs. HM Submarine A1 HMS/M A1 was built by Vickers in 1902 and was the first submarine which was British designed and built used by the Royal Navy. She was commissioned in 1903, but tragically lost with all hands in a collision off the Nab Light in 1904. The submarine was raised in 1904 and then used for training and experimental purposes. HMS/M A1 was finally lost during an unmanned exercise. Despite the extensive searches, the Royal Navy was unable to locate the submarine. The wreck was rediscovered in 1989 and designated a historic wreck under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 in 1998. Wessex Archaeology conducted a magnetometer survey, a sub bottom profiler survey and a multibeam sonar survey of the wreck site in 2003. More information on this can be found in the Wrecks on the Seabed archive. The geophysical survey data is archived through the MEDIN Data Archive Centres(British Geological Survey and United Kingdom Hydrographic Office).",

This work was undertaken by Archaeology South-East between January to February 2021. A preceding geophysical survey detected a range of anomalies of possible or probable archaeological origin, mainly concentrated in the western part of the site, indicating the potential presence of a series of ditched enclosures. A total of fifty-five evaluation trenches were investigated across the northern 8.8ha of the overall 18.4ha site. Archaeological features were recorded in thirty-nine trenches and comprised ditches, pits and possible postholes. A close correspondence between the archaeological evaluation and geophysical survey results was evident, though smaller features such as pits and postholes had generally not been detected as geophysical anomalies. Remains of Early Iron Age ditched enclosures, a possible trackway and a few pits were found in two distinct concentrations in the west and east of the evaluated area. Remains of Roman ditched field / enclosure systems were recorded across the west half of the evaluated area. A further Roman ditch was found in the east. The significant quantity and range of artefacts and plant remains recovered from these Roman period features(especially from a few ditches in the west) suggests that they relate to a rural settlement, such as a farmstead, located in the near vicinity. A number of ditches defining former field boundaries, along with quarries and other pits, relate to the agricultural use of this landscape in the late post-medieval and early modern periods. The boundary ditches are shown on historic mapping from the earlier 19th century onwards.",

A total of 41 trenches out of the proposed 63 trenches were excavated. A very high water table, large areas of standing water and near-constant rainfall prevented the remainder if the trenches from being opened. Trial trenching revealed a very limited number of archaeological features, finds or deposits across the area mainly consisting of Medieval to post-Medieval drainage ditches and field boundaries. The results suggest an extended period of use as pastoral land, latterly in association with Caldecote Farm and Mill, with a brief period of arable agriculture in the high Medieval period, evidenced by the standing remains of Ridge and Furrow across the central, southern part of the site. Very few archaeological artefacts were recovered, making precise dating of features difficult, and further supporting low levels of human activity or input within the area. Small quantities of artefacts were recovered including four flints, four pieces of animal bone, six sherds of Late Iron Age / Roman pottery, nineteen sherds of Medieval pottery - largely dating from between the late 11th-14th centuries - and five post-medieval artefacts. 80 % of the finds were recovered from the pasture land in the central, eastern part of the site towards the river(Trenches 43-49).",

An area of 1.47ha was excavated within this part of a wider development area.  The earliest remains comprised three broadly datable flints, all found as residual finds. An Early Bronze Age collared urn within a small pit may be the remains of a grave, although no human remains were found. The first evidence for occupation is from the Roman period, with finds spanning the 1st to 3rd centuries AD, with a clear focus within the 2nd to 3rd centuries. Two phases of Roman activity were identified, the first comprising cereal-processing ovens and two crescent-shaped ditches, one associated with metalworking debris. The later phase comprised stone founded buildings associated with wells, enclosures, trackways and a single cremation deposit. These seem to indicate a Romanised farm below the status of a villa. Little animal bone survived, but the enclosures are suggestive of livestock farming. Occupation seems to have ended in the mid 3rd century, although the reasons for this are not apparent. Further use of the site dates to the medieval period, between the late 12th and 15th centuries, when an agricultural building was constructed, probably an outlier of a manorial farm previously excavated to the west.",

A total of 7 trenches were excavated across the 0.61ha site, which is located approximately 100m to the east of a Roman pottery production site identified during the construction of the Oxford Eastern Bypass. Archaeological remains were identified in trenches 3, 4 and 5. No evidence for any activity pre-dating the Roman period was identified, with the earliest dated feature being ditch 403, in trench 4, which produced pottery of mid-Roman date. The fill of this ditch was cut by a small pit or posthole, 405, that produced pottery of late Roman date, as did ditch / gully 503, to the southwest, indicating a C3 - C4 phase of activity and collectively suggesting use of the site from as early as the mid-2nd to the 4th century. No evidence for industrial activity on the site was seen in the form of either pottery wasters or kiln furniture, or industrial residue dumps, although the quantity of pottery recovered from the features investigated suggests a proximity to settlement or a working area. Consequently, it is possible that the activity identified on the site is related, albeit perhaps being on the periphery, to the kilns / pottery production site noted during construction of the Eastern Bypass. No evidence for Early Medieval(Saxon) or Medieval activity was identified during the evaluation, while a single sherd of post-medieval pottery recovered from the subsoil in trench 3 was most likely introduced onto the site via agricultural manuring practices. Modern disturbance / truncation to the natural substrate / archaeological horizon was only seen in trench 7, where part of a large modern pit was seen, while in trench 6 the original subsoil and topsoil appear to have been left in -situ, buried beneath a thin layer of imported redeposited silt-clay and topsoil seemingly laid as part of the landscaping works associated with the construction of the Hostel complex.",

MOM14: An archaeological evaluation was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology in May and June 2014 at Mount Mill Farm, Wicken, Northamptonshire. Forty-five trenches were excavated. The evaluation recorded a series of substantial and well-preserved Iron Age ditches, corresponding to the three concentrations of enclosures and associated features recorded previously by a geophysical survey. It is likely that these three concentrations of features represent Iron Age farmsteads. The evaluation generally confirmed the limits of the three concentrations of Iron Age activity as defined by the geophysical survey. There was no evidence for activity pre-dating the Iron Age, and there were very few later features. MMW15: In January to March 2015, a programme of archaeological observation, investigation and recording was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology during groundworks associated with the construction of a solar farm at Mount Mill Farm, Wicken, Northamptonshire. A previous archaeological evaluation and a geophysical survey of the site had recorded an Iron Age farmstead within the site's eastern field. The programme of archaeological observation, investigation and recording identified a single undated ditch. The monitored groundworks were outside of the main concentration of Iron Age features recorded by the previous archaeological investigations. The lack of features exposed during the present works confirms that the previous investigations accurately defined the limits of the archaeological remains at the site.",

SAWR18 In June 2018, Oxford Archaeology were commissioned by Taylor Wimpey to undertake an archaeological evaluation on the site of a proposed housing development to the north of West Road, Sawbridgeworth(TL 47842 15448). A programme of 19 trenches was undertaken to ground truth the results of a geophysical survey and to assess the archaeological potential of the site. The evaluation confirmed the presence of archaeological remains in areas identified on the geophysics. Parts of a NW-SE‐aligned trackway were found in Trenches 1 and 2. Field boundaries identified by geophysics(also present on the 1839 tithe map) were found in Trenches 5 and 7, towards the south of the site, and in Trenches 12 and 16, in the centre of the site. Geophysical anomalies identified in the northern part of the site were investigated and identified as geological. The archaeology is consistent with the geophysical survey results and it is likely that much of it has been truncated by modern agricultural activity. SAWR21 Oxford Archaeology carried out an archaeological evaluation on the site of proposed residential development north of West Road, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, in February 2021. The fieldwork was commissioned by Taylor Wimpey as a condition of planning permission. Preceding geophysical survey of the c 5.7ha development site was undertaken in 2016 and identified a concentration of linear and curvilinear anomalies in the north-east corner of the site and two areas of several broadly NW-SE aligned anomalies in the southern half of the site. Subsequent trial trench evaluation, comprising the investigation of 19 trenches, was undertaken by Oxford Archaeology in 2018, targeted upon the geophysical survey results. The evaluation revealed a small number of ditches in the centre and south of the site, correlating with the geophysical anomalies. Although generally undated, the ditches were suggestive of a trackway and associated enclosure/field boundaries. Other ditches encountered on site correlated with post-medieval field boundaries depicted on 19th century mapping. Given the results of the 2018 evaluation, in conjunction with those of the 2018 investigations at nearby Chalk's Farm, which uncovered the remains of late Bronze Age-early Iron Age and early Roman settlement and agricultural activity, it was deemed necessary to undertake a further phase of evaluation at the site. Four additional trenches were excavated in the southern half of the site to further investigate the previously revealed ditches. The continuations of the trackway ditches were revealed in the centre of the site, with remnants of a metalled surface also identified. Adjacent ditches may demonstrate the maintenance and modification of the trackway or perhaps associated enclosure/field boundaries. Artefactual dating evidence recovered from these ditches was limited and of mixed date, comprising small pottery sherds of late Bronze Age-early Iron Age date and fragments of Roman ceramic building material. It is probable that these remains provide evidence of outlying agricultural activity associated with the later prehistoric and early Roman settlement evidence at Chalk's Farm. A further undated ditch and a parallel early Roman ditch were revealed in the south of the site, suggestive of additional land divisions, probably agricultural features. A post-medieval field boundary ditch and modern land drains are demonstrative of agricultural use of the landscape during these periods.",

Five trenches were initially excavated across the 3ha Site. An additional trench was subsequently excavated to further investigate a localised cluster of four pits. The pits produced pottery of Late Iron Age/Roman date as well as small quantities of animal bone including cattle, sheep/goat, pig, and dog. A single isolated undated V-shaped ditch was also investigated in Trench 5, at the south-eastern end of the Site, possibly representing a former field boundary. The results of the fieldwork suggest a low level of activity within the Site during the Late Iron Age/Roman period, possibly suggesting that the Site lay within the agricultural hinterland of a contemporary settlement to the north and / or east, where further Roman activity has been recorded.

Work was undertaken by Oxford Archaeology between October 2019 and October 2020. Phase 1 Between 28th October and 8th November 2019, Oxford Archaeology undertook a trial trench evaluation on the site of a proposed mixed development at Foxbridge, Swindon. The works comprised the excavation of 30 trenches and formed the first of three phases of evaluation undertaken within the proposed development area. The 30 trenches were located in the northern half of the proposed development area and included five trenches targeted on geophysical anomalies provisionally interpreted as the continuation of Durocornovium Roman Town, a Scheduled Monument located to the north of and partially within the site. Archaeological remains consistent with Roman roadside activity were identified within these five trenches. It is the intention to preserve this remains in situ and given poor ground conditions during the works, excavation of the exposed features was minimally intrusive. The remains comprised rectilinear enclosures, pits and a couple of postholes but no evidence for in situ structural remains was identified. The activity is contained within a 50m wide strip that runs parallel to the Wanborough Road, which forms the eastern site boundary, and is delimited to the west by a large enclosure ditch. Features of potential archaeological origin investigated to the west of this ditch were demonstrated to be of geological origin. The finds assemblage comprises 396 sherds of Roman pottery, ceramic building material, glass and metal objects, worked flint, animal bone and stone. The assemblage suggests the activity within the site occurred predominately in the middle Roman period with none of the contexts dated to earlier than the 2nd century. The pottery assemblage, however, does contain sherds dating to the late Roman period suggesting activity within the site continued into the 4th and early 5th centuries. This is supported by the metalwork assemblage which includes six late Roman coins. Although no obvious in situ building remains were present, several fragments of roof tile and unworked limestone were recovered and suggest the presence of structures within the vicinity. Similarly, the recovery of metal working slag suggests industrial activities occurred within the area, but no evidence was recorded within the trenches. A single inhumation was identified, and although heavily disturbed it is believed to be that of an adult male. A buried soil of unknown origin was recorded sealing the archaeological features. The origin of this deposit is uncertain, but it is suspected to represent a former land surface or occupation layer. No archaeological features or deposit were recorded in the trenches located beyond those targeting the roadside activity.  Phase 2 In August 2020, Oxford Archaeology undertook a trial-trench evaluation at the site of a proposed mixed development. The works comprised the excavation of seven trenches within the scheduled area of the Roman town of Durocornovium. Although evenly distributed across the site, several of the trenches were positioned to investigate anomalies identified by geophysical survey. The correlation between geophysical anomalies and the features exposed during the evaluation was poor. Despite this, the evaluation identified a concentration of middle and late Roman activity. Wanbrough Road, which forms the eastern site boundary, follows the route of the Roman road of Ermin street. The distribution of features within the site suggests a focus of activity along the roadside. Beam slots indicate the presence of a wooden structure dating to the middle Roman period, and three stone walls form a multi-phased, multi-roomed building of unknown function. Ditches forming a rectangular enclosure and possible trackways were also present. Pottery recovered from the features suggest they originated in the middle Roman period. Many of the ditches appear to have been maintained or re-established, and artefactual evidence suggest several continued in use into the late Roman period. Further away from Ermin street, in the south-west corner of the site, the remains of a small cemetery were exposed. Eight inhumation burials were identified and extending beyond the limits of one of the trenches. The extent of the cemetery is unknown, but the southern limit appears to be defined by a small gully. The finds assemblage comprised 827 sherds of Roman pottery, the majority of which dates to the late Roman period, as well as glass, metal objects including coins, and animal bones.  Phase 3 In late September and early October 2020, Oxford Archaeology undertook a trial-trench evaluation at Foxbridge, Swindon, the site of a proposed mixed development. The works comprised the excavation of 29 trenches and is the third phase of evaluation undertaken within the site. Due to prolong heavy rain the trenches became waterlogged during the evaluation. While it is not considered that these conditions hindered the identification of archaeological remains within the trenches, it did impact the level of hand excavation that could be undertaken and therefore the characterisation of several features identified. Archaeological features dating from the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic period through to the post-medieval period were recorded across the area. The archaeological features were distributed across the site and predominately comprised ditches and a number of pits. The trenches were positioned to ground truth the results of a geophysical survey. The correlation between the results of the survey and the trial trenching is mixed. Geophysical anomalies interpreted as 'positive linear archaeology' were all present and were dated to the medieval and postmedieval periods. However, the correlation between anomalies interpreted with less certainty was moderately poor. While some archaeological features were identified that correlated with the anomalies, there was no evidence for others. Several archaeological features were also identified during the evaluation that were not identified by the geophysical survey. The earliest activity recorded comprises an assemblage of struck flint from an alluvial deposit in the centre of the site. The assemblage includes blade cores and debitage indicative of blade production dating to the early Neolithic period, although a late Mesolithic date is possible. Although the assemblage was not recovered from an in situ scatter, the struck flint is fresh and is unlikely to have been moved far from the original point of deposition, suggesting flint production within the site. A small prehistoric enclosure was also identified. The absence of internal features suggest it served an agricultural function as a stock enclosure, rather than being indicative of domestic/settlement activity. Pottery recovered from the feature has been dated to the mid to late Bronze Age and the early to middle Iron Age. Prehistoric pottery was also recovered from a number of ditches. Previous evaluations within the Foxbridge site have identified significant activity of Roman date associated with Wanborough Roman town, which lies to the north. Only four land management ditches of Roman date were recorded during this phase of evaluation. Dated to the 1st and 2nd centuries, the ditches are more likely to be associated with an early Roman farmstead located 300m to the south-west of the site than with the activity recorded during the previous phases of evaluation within the Foxbridge site which is predominately of middle and late Roman date. The Phase 3 area appears to lie between the two foci of Roman activity. The ditches dating to both the prehistoric and Roman periods represent land management and drainage, but it is not possible to define any field systems based on their orientation and distribution.   Enclosure ditches most likely associated with a small medieval/post-medieval farmstead were also recorded within the site."

A narrative detailing the sequence of Roman remains at the site was produced by Hall, Evans and Ottaway(2011, 199-221) using details from the original Level III report archive report(Evans 1997). In 2003 the six burials were assessed by Dr S. Mays from the Ancient Monuments Laboratory, English Heritage(now the Research Department of Historic England). The present report was commissioned and funded by Historic England to ensure the publication and dissemination of this small but important group of burials. The report collates the information relating to the excavated remains(based on Hall et al. 2011, 213-7) and the osteological analysis of the six skeletons recovered(Mays 2003). Details of the individual graves are given in the burial catalogue."

        "text": "This collection comprises site data(reports, images, a CAD drawing, spreadsheets, databases, GIS data and site records) from the second phase of archaeological work associated with the development of a new onshore substation and related infrastructure for Galloper Offshore Wind Farm. Between 2011 and 2016, Wessex Archaeology carried out a programme of trial trenching, area excavation and watching briefs in association with the onshore elements of the Galloper Offshore Wind Farm development. This part of the archive relates to fieldwork between 2014 and 2016 under project numbers 104810-104812. The investigated area coincided with the footprint of the new onshore substation, located between Leiston and Sizewell, some 1 km from the Suffolk coast, as well as the cable route linking it to the landfall site on Sizewell beach. The works revealed little evidence for activity during earlier prehistoric periods, although a cluster of pits and other features seem to be indicative of Early Iron Age occupation. One of the pits was notable due to the large quantity(over 6 kg) of pottery and fired clay found in its upper fill. Several undated ditches may represent the fragmentary remains of a late prehistoric field system. The principal findings of the investigations relate to the early and mid-Romano-British period, with an extensive system of conjoined enclosures and trackways periodically modified and abandoned after the mid-3rd century AD. Four cremation graves, dating to the late 1st to mid-2nd centuries AD, were also found near the margins of the enclosure complex. Although the enclosures are thought to have largely been used for agricultural purposes - particularly livestock management - there were also indications of contemporary occupation, possibly the remains of a farmstead. The unexpected almost total absence of post-Roman remains seems to suggest the westward expansion of medieval Sizewell was constrained, to the south, by the route of Sizewell Gap. Fieldwork undertaken from 2010 to 2013, under projects 77610 and 77611 are deposited separately in part 1."
