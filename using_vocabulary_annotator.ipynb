These components are based on existing monolingual (English) thesauri so they can currently be used to identify and tag English language terms. The following entity types can be tagged by the VocabularyAnnotator. Entity types can be selectively included/excluded and the pipeline can also be re-ordered during initialisation:\n",

The evaluation was commissioned by Pegasus Planning Group, acting on behalf of Haymaker Energy Ltd, and was carried out prior to the submission of a planning application for the construction of a solar park on the site. Evidence for Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age activity, comprising a pit and a ditch from which a small assemblage of pottery was recovered, was encountered on the south-east facing slope overlooking the valley of Silverstone Brook. In the same area the remains of a small Roman settlement, probably a farmstead and associated field system, were identified. The Roman features contained pottery, animal bone and fragments of Roman roof tile, the latter indicating that there may have been a building in the vicinity. The Middle/Late Saxon remains comprised a circular or oval enclosure, although no evidence was encountered for features within the enclosure. Pottery dateable to the 7th to 10th centuries, a fragment of an iron pin or bobbin and a metal fragment, possibly part of a bucket with mineralised wood fibres adhering to its surface, were recovered from the enclosure ditch. The archaeological features broadly corresponded with anomalies detected by a geophysical survey of the site, although in a number of instances there was only an approximate correlation with the geophysical survey results, possibly due to the highly variable geology. Many of the anomalies interpreted as being of possible archaeological significance were confirmed as geological in origin and several features were identified that were not detected by the geophysical survey.\"\"\"\n",

The earliest features, which accounted for the majority of the remains on site, relate to medieval agricultural activity focused within a large enclosure. There was little to suggest domestic occupation within the site: the pottery assemblage was modest and well abraded, whilst charred plant remains were sparse, and, as with some metallurgical residues, point to waste disposal rather than the locations of processing or consumption. A focus of occupation within the Rodley Manor site, on higher ground 160m to the north-west, seems likely, with the currently site having lain beyond this and providing agricultural facilities, most likely corrals and pens for livestock.

Very few archaeological artefacts were recovered, making precise dating of features difficult, and further supporting low levels of human activity or input within the area. Small quantities of artefacts were recovered including four flints, four pieces of animal bone, six sherds of Late Iron Age / Roman pottery, nineteen sherds of Medieval pottery - largely dating from between the late 11th-14th centuries - and five post-medieval artefacts. 80% of the finds were recovered from the pasture land in the central, eastern part of the site towards the river (Trenches 43-49).\"\"\"\n",

Two phases of Roman activity were identified, the first comprising cereal-processing ovens and two crescent-shaped ditches, one associated with metalworking debris. The later phase comprised stone founded buildings associated with wells, enclosures, trackways and a single cremation deposit. These seem to indicate a Romanised farm below the status of a villa. Little animal bone survived, but the enclosures are suggestive of livestock farming. Occupation seems to have ended in the mid 3rd century, although the reasons for this are not apparent.\n",

Archaeological remains were identified in trenches 3, 4 and 5. No evidence for any activity pre-dating the Roman period was identified, with the earliest dated feature being ditch 403, in trench 4, which produced pottery of mid-Roman date. The fill of this ditch was cut by a small pit or posthole, 405, that produced pottery of late Roman date, as did ditch / gully 503, to the southwest, indicating a C3 - C4 phase of activity and collectively suggesting use of the site from as early as the mid-2nd to the 4th century. No evidence for industrial activity on the site was seen in the form of either pottery wasters or kiln furniture, or industrial residue dumps, although the quantity of pottery recovered from the features investigated suggests a proximity to settlement or a working area. Consequently, it is possible that the activity identified on the site is related, albeit perhaps being on the periphery, to the kilns/ pottery production site noted during construction of the Eastern Bypass.\n",

    "Oxford Archaeology carried out an archaeological evaluation on the site of proposed residential development north of West Road, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, in February 2021. The fieldwork was commissioned by Taylor Wimpey as a condition of planning permission.\n",
    "Preceding geophysical survey of the c 5.7ha development site was undertaken in 2016 and identified a concentration of linear and curvilinear anomalies in the north-east corner of the site and two areas of several broadly NW-SE aligned anomalies in the southern half of the site. Subsequent trial trench evaluation, comprising the investigation of 19 trenches, was undertaken by Oxford Archaeology in 2018, targeted upon the geophysical survey results. The evaluation revealed a small number of ditches in the centre and south of the site, correlating with the geophysical anomalies. Although generally undated, the ditches were suggestive of a trackway and associated enclosure/field boundaries. Other ditches encountered on site correlated with post-medieval field boundaries depicted on 19th-century mapping.\n",
    "Given the results of the 2018 evaluation, in conjunction with those of the 2018 investigations at nearby Chalk's Farm, which uncovered the remains of late Bronze Age-early Iron Age and early Roman settlement and agricultural activity, it was deemed necessary to undertake a further phase of evaluation at the site. Four additional trenches were excavated in the southern half of the site to further investigate the previously revealed ditches.\n",
    "The continuations of the trackway ditches were revealed in the centre of the site, with remnants of a metalled surface also identified. Adjacent ditches may demonstrate the maintenance and modification of the trackway or perhaps associated enclosure/field boundaries. Artefactual dating evidence recovered from these ditches was limited and of mixed date, comprising small pottery sherds of late Bronze Age-early Iron Age date and fragments of Roman ceramic building material. It is probable that these remains provide evidence of outlying agricultural activity associated with the later prehistoric and early Roman settlement evidence at Chalk's Farm.\n",
    "A further undated ditch and a parallel early Roman ditch were revealed in the south of the site, suggestive of additional land divisions, probably agricultural features. A post-medieval field boundary ditch and modern land drains are demonstrative of agricultural use of the landscape during these periods.\n",
